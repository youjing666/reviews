2,An average smart humidifier,Overall it¡¯s a good humidifier but I think it¡¯s not should not stop automatically when the tank is empty. But it will notify the tank is empty.
3,Humidifier stopped connecting to WIFI even after resetting it and my home network.,
4,mold problem within the first month of use,"This humidifier definitely humidifies.  Unfortunately all my glass surfaces in the room had a film on them even though I used this humidifier on the auto setting.  My biggest complaint with this product is that I found it difficult to clean.  The vinegar did not remove the pink mold that was accumulating after 2-3 weeks of use.  The cleaning brush did not reach into the nooks and crannies, so I stopped using the humidifier because I want it completely free of mold.  I would return it except it appears to only have a 30 day window for return.  Bummer."
5,Ultra simple ultra functional humidifier,"Made long dry indoor winter comfortable with just the right amount of humidity. Super quiet, ultra light, and easy to refill. Wi-Fi smart devise control feature is nice too."
6,Not as smart as advertised,Connection to Wi-Fi is difficult. Had to reset it to factory settings to make it work. Customer Service number is a non-answering number so don¡¯t bother. Had to call Amazon to troubleshoot. Not a good experience overall. I would NOT recommend this item.
7,Water tank flooded on to floor,"I liked the product. It worked well for about 3 weeks. After that when I would refill the tank and place it on the base it would flood ALOT of water all over the floor. I was willing to pay a bit more for a superior product. however, this is not a superior product. I never dropped it or mistreated it in any way and it still developed a massive misfunction just as the Amazon return expired. I now have a $70 piece of plastic"
8,Easy fill,I like that it tells the humidity and in auto mode shuts down when at the acceptable range. Also very quiet.
9,Works as advertised,"We like the device so far. It's in our bedroom, so we appreciate the ability to turn off the display at night."
10,Quiet but cracks easily,I thought I was about to sleep better but this product cracks very easily. Ordered it had it only 3 days and it cracked and water was coming out. Got a replacement and had it less than 24 hrs it cracked in same place and leaking water
11,"White dust, my cheap humidifier works better","Esthetically pleasing, and works as described, lots of functions. However, this leaves white dust if you don't use distilled water.
I have separate humidistats everywhere in my home so I have been able to compare it to my cheapy humidifier. Fyi the humidistat is not accurate.  My Vick's Warm Steam no function humidifier works better, just doesn't have any extra functions. Very arid region and this one can't keep up with the cheapy. Likely returning."
12,Nice humidifier. One part is hard to clean.,"Very happy with this humidifier. There's one part that is hard to clean (an unremovable plastic part inside the chimney where the mist comes out), but otherwise it's a very quiet and reliable humidifier."
13,The best humidifier I've ever used,"I cannot say enough good things about this humidifier.
I've got bad allergies that are very sensitive to humidity and I grew up with a brother who had asthma so I've been using humidifiers my whole life. I've tried them all.
So please believe me when I say this is the actual best humidifier I have ever used.
It is so easy to fill - just pull the lid off and pour water in. No having to juggle the tank and the cap for it while you're pouring to avoid getting the table wet.
It is eerily quiet. I genuinely didn't even know it was on the first time until I bent down to listen and got a face full of mist.
We bought these without any consideration for the wifi connectivity - it wasn't on our priority list at all but holy crap is it so convenient. I can keep an eye on it when I'm at work if we've left it on or can turn off the display screen when we've already laid down for bed & have forgotten about it.
I've not used a humidifier with a display screen before, so I am so glad this one comes with the sleep mode to turn it off.
The best feature, by far though is the auto mode. Set it to a target humidity and just let it run. I have genuinely forgotten about them some days.
We bought two of these for our apartment - one for the living room and one for the bedroom. We've struggled with our old humidifiers and we were going through an uncomfortable amount of distilled water keeping them on all the time.
We've had these for about a week and already they keep this place at the most comfortable it's been since we've moved in. We wake up less congested and dry. I've stopped shocking the poor cat every time I pet him. I've stopped shocking MYSELF every time I get up off the couch. The cat has stopped scratching as much and his dandruff has all but disappeared. & they only run for maybe an hour a day total.
A humidifier is such a mundane thing to get excited about but when I can just completely forget about them and live more comfortable after years of struggling, I am SO EXCITED about these. I have told all my friends about them. They've changed my life.
I would consider them a little bit expensive, but they have been worth every penny so far."
14,Buttons are not the best part of this appliance,Works really great but wish the buttons on the machine were more tactile like buttons and didn¡¯t feel like I was pressing a plastic sheet. Hard to find buttons in the dark
15,Saved my stringed instruments!,This gets it done! My basses and guitars were suffering due to the dryness of the air. Being able to set this and forget it definitely has saved my investment!
16,Excellent features in this humidifier,"Very quiet, easy to fill"
17,What they don't tell you,"I bought this humidifier after becoming a plant papa this year and after noticing how dry my own skin was becoming this winter¡ª and I can say I have been satisfied with its performance, overall. The tank holds enough water to last a few days at times and after about an hour on the highest level¡ª I noticed a firm difference in the room. It's quiet and the automatic setting is nice too¡ª knowing it's only running when necessary is a relief since I have a lot of books in the room its in.

One thing worth mentioning more is the cleaning process:
1) Ideally, it should be cleaned thoroughly everyday. This includes letting the machine thoroughly dry before each use.
2) cleaning instructions suggest avoiding steriles, and opt for using white vinegar instead, and you will find yourself disassembling things you thought were permanent fixtures
3) my cousin and I purchased ours at the same time¡ª and we called one another after noticing that our white filters were turning orangey/brown¡ª I'm in NY and she's in NC. You'll need to soak the filter in a vinegar solutions, and that'll run you some time, I've read.
3) This thing produces A LOT of mist so you may also find dust caked onto surrounding surfaces too

Overall, we're all glad we got it. She said her asthma has improved and my skin (psoriasis) has definitely responded well to it, so have my babes. It's bulkier than you might expect too since you crowd objects around it for risk of mildew and things, so be prepared to give it a corner of its own.

If I had to get another, I might try something different, but this one would be the standard I'd expect and I could see myself coming back to it. Cleaning is a hassle, but living well isnt a walk in the park."
18,Great while it worked....,"Convenient and great while it worked. Loved the wifi control. Unfortunately, steam stopped coming out today. Thankfully, it's just shy of a month so still within the return/exchange window. Replacement is supposed to come tomorrow.

I also don't understand why you cannot return it to Whole Foods drop-off points for this product when I can for other items. It's the closest drop-off spot to me. Will update if the second one lasts over a month...."
19,Hard to clean,"The humidifier is very quiet and I love the smart features.  But it¡¯s impossible to clean because there are so many tight spaces a brush cannot get to.  My humidifier was five the first few weeks of cleaning but now I can see that pink-red slime bacteria in parts that I can¡¯t reach.  For example looking down at the tank, inside the tube where the mist comes out at the bottom there¡¯s a white piece that is thin and has a lip around it.  There¡¯s red bacteria all over it but our hands can¡¯t get down there and a long scrub brush is either too large, or it doesn¡¯t have the stiffness to clean that area.  And there are other similar areas.  I don¡¯t know why they don¡¯t make a dishwasher safe tank.  I¡¯d pay more for the ease of cleaning and safety!"
20,"Nice, silent humidifier","Great product for it's price, nice, silent work, and filling from the top of it - awesome addition to its convenient."
21,You need it.,"Gone are the days of me refilling a humidifier daily or even more than once or twice a week! This thing is amazing. I have very dry skin and my bedroom is dry so this was desperately needed.  I love having this and the Smart Control features are seriously the best. You can control everything from an app on your phone if you don¡¯t wanna use the manual buttons. It suggests a humidity range for you but you can set it at anything. The night light feature is handy and the sleep feature turns off all lights so that¡¯s great as well. If you¡¯re thinking about it, get it!"
22,Humidity Sensor stopped working after 30 days,"This is a solid product but do not depend on it. Other have had the same issue, after refilling one day it always shows 15-20points higher than actual humidity. I¡¯ve reset it twice and now my grow room has suffered. It¡¯s my fault for not having a fail safe but I really am disappointed. I have to reach out to the company for support and will edit once that¡¯s over."
23,Bought this for my bulldog. Great product. Nice Bluetooth feature,"It¡¯s a nice product. Haven¡¯t cleaned it yet.
Purchased for my bulldog"
24,"One of the best humidifiers and app I¡¯ve ever had, thanks",I really like everything about this humidifier
25,Crap construction,Thin two part plastic tank cracked within two weeks of use. It is now more plastic trash.
26,Not the easiest to figure out,"It¡¯s fine. But that¡¯s as far as I¡¯ll go. It¡¯s fine. It definitely does not last 5 nights, but it is a large tank. The app is fine but not great-wish it would say when water is low, not just out. Set it on a schedule for night time. Aroma pad may last 30 minutes. It is ginormous and not something I want seen. It started in the living room but is such an eye sore I moved it to hallway near bedrooms. It¡¯s fine. Wouldn¡¯t buy this one again."
27,Perfect for my plants,This is perfect for my plants.  It has a large capacity tank and I set it on a scheduled timer throughout the week.  It also works with Alexa which is great!
28,Super quiet and efficient,"I expected to hear something from this humidifier but honestly it makes no sound! We keep it on automatic so it maintains the humidity between 40-50% on its own. Since using it, our noses haven't been as dry this winter. The bight mode turns off the display for those bothered by lights while sleeping (my favorite feature). Others mentioned needing an app, I have not downloaded anything and mine works fine."
29,Excellent product!,This humidifier seems to have it all. Having an automatic shut off when the tank is empty with an alert to a smart phone is a clear plus. The entire top of the tank is easily lifted off for both filling and emptying. It puts out copious moisture and does a great job of  humidifying my large room. Love this humidifier!
30,the tank is huge.,"I have multiple humidifiers scattered around my 2 bedroom apt.  This one is gives great coverage, but I do find it hard to clean the nooks and crannies.  I bought it because of its open top which was supposed to offer access to all.  It comes close but there are still places I cant reach.  And it matters."
31,Great Option for a Single Room Humidifier,"Love this product.  It's effective, quiet, and easy to keep clean.  Like the app too."
32,Leaking!!,I have only had this product a few months and it started leaking out the side and all over. I'm very disappointed that this humidifier lasted less than 6 months.
33,I love the app that I can control it with!,This is one of the best humidifiers. The humidity isn¡¯t always entirely accurate but it¡¯s been great for my plants! I love that I can use an app! Also it puts out a lot of smell from the essential oil tray.
34,Best out of the last 4 humidifiers I¡¯ve bought!!!,"I would highly recommend LEVOIT Humidifier to any of my friends and family who needed 1. It works great! The water will last about a week, without having to fill again. I bought 3 other brands. 1 of them didn't adjust below 55 degrees, the other 1 didn¡¯t let you adjust lower than 75% and all of the other 3 had to be filled every 24-36 hours."
35,Easy to use,This is a great humidifier. I definitely recommend it. The only thing I struggled with was how to change the target humidity level for the auto mode and then I accidentally found it by swiping up on the app and things are good now.
36,Love the top fill.,Great humidifier.  Have 1 in the living room and one in the dining room.  Small but work well for my needs.  Top fill is great!
37,Annoying high pitched noise,"It was good for the first 2 months though it¡¯s annoying that you have to use app to make some basic changes, like desired humidity etc. But the most horrible thing is it has a super high pitched noise while running and no way to sleep with this thing on. I own couple humidifiers from this brand, only one is still running quietly, another older model does have noise, but not as crazy as this one."
38,Easy to use and so quiet!,Easy to use and so quiet!  Love it.
39,"Quiet, easy, amazing","Was easy to set up, is easy to fill, makes NO noise whatsoever and keeps the humidity level between 42-52%."
40,Excellent humidifier,Works perfectly as described. Love the app feature.
41,Best Humidifier Ever,I have never had a humidifier that ran so quietly.  It supports our large bedroom and even has a number setting that is large and bright to read.  I would recommend this to anyone who needed a humidifier.
42,Ordered overnight and got it in the morning,"Easy to use, app is easy too. Happy with it."
43,,"My houseplants need more humidity because I use the heater during the winter months.  The humidifier helps keep my plants healthy.  This humidifier has a large water tank, so I don¡¯t have to refill often, which is definitely a plus."
44,inconvenient,"you have to use purified or distilled water, this is a pain to have to buy water every day, the 6 quarts doesn't even last a day"
45,A Good Overall Product,I am beginning to turn my home into a Smart Home without a hub and this product works very well with Alexa. It does what it is supposed to do. My water is softened so there is a salt residue but the Humidifier has been working perfectly all winter.
46,Lifesaver,This thing is great!  I love love love it.  It¡¯s pretty easy to use with app.  Works amazingly.
47,it is soooooo quiet!!!!  i can control it remotely!!!!,i really love it & my dog loves it too!!!! the dog has had bronchitis due to running the a/c all day.  we solved his problem!  it's so quiet you don't even know it's on except for the mist.
48,Easy to fill and use.,"Silent and efficient operation, easy setup."
49,Hands down best humidifier.,We have gone through a dozen humidifiers. Save your money and buy this one (we bought two). Does not cost ¡°wetness¡± in areas of the vapors. Controls are clean and simple. App is awesome. Added option of ability to add essential oils. Highly recommend.
50,"Wi-fi a little iffy, otherwise great","As a humidifier, it works great, is quiet and easy to fill.  On the other hand, setting up the wi-fi was a pain in the keister.  Regardless, I still recommend it."
51,Quiet and long lasting vapor,super quiet and easy to refill
52,"""I love this thing"" -my girlfriend after I broke her other humidifier",Very good. Humidifies well. Does not use too much water. Easy to clean. Quiet. Actually cute looking
53,Quite and work nice,"Like it in general.

-: the hygrometer is not correct. May affect the auto mode. It may wet area near it more but it¡¯s a problem of such type of humidifier.
+: tank size is enough for three nights use on high mode."
54,Leaks right out of the box, Just got it unboxed it and put water in it amd water leaks right from the tank. The seam is at the bottom held by glue which mean eventually it can leak even if I change it because it is a bad design. Should either have been molded 1 piece at the bottom or use oring with clasp or screws to hold it together.
55,"Sleep mode does not work, but it's easy to clean and the tank is huge so it's easy to refill.","I use this every night to keep my sinuses and skin from acting up, and I really like this humidifier. I have to block the light from the buttons with a plant because sleep mode seems to just turn it off which is sort of stupid, but other than that it's great. I clean this by letting it soak in white vinegar weekly (just soaking the bottom portion, not putting vinegar in the actual tank) and it looks brand new still."
56,"The fanciest, quietist and sleek humidifier ever",I have no complaints. This is our second levoit product (we also have an air purifier) and they are so sleek yet so user friendly! Love.
57,Best product,Loved it
58,Easy to clean,I¡¯m pleased that it is easy to clean and refill and quiet running.
59,Quiet and efficient,"It¡¯s usually 30-40% or lower humidity in our Sierra Nevada home with thinner air in our slightly higher elevation. We usually have extremely dry, cracked noses where we constantly use saline nasal spray and lots of tissues. After much research, we decided to go with this cool air humidifier (cool air is healthier anyways). It is quiet enough we have to make sure it¡¯s on and we even bought another for our baby¡¯s room (the Frida baby humidifier we had could not keep up with the dryness and stayed at 40% humidity even on high and requires more water refills). We fill our humidifier up every night with a little over 1 gallon of distilled water. We¡¯ve been using it with an Aqua Stick which helped maintain the cleanliness in between cleaning (Part Vinegar and Part distilled solution and let it sit then scrub after). We used distilled water because the water here is so bad and heavily calcifies (military base housing), but it really makes a difference and doesn¡¯t cause buildups. We registered for the warranty with no problem, but we did not download any apps because we aren¡¯t lazy and can easily, manually turn off the screen by holding down the nightlight button. We keep the humidifier on high throughout the night starting from 5pm until 8am (humidity levels reach 70+%) and water level is still at about 1/4 full. Definitely recommend getting this humidifier (along with a humidifier cleaner stick) if you¡¯re looking for a quality humidifier."
60,Best humidifier I have ever had,This was easy to put together. Set it up in my Dads room it runs 24/7 on low. No problems with it at all. No noise and easy to cleans. Would highly recommend this unit. Love the oil option for smell.
61,SOOO QUIET!!!,"We have bought more expensive machines, and this one beats them all! It is virtually noise-less (like soo quiet) and is easy to refill with a large tank. It is a smart system which knows when to release steam and not, and we love how low maintenance it is. Set it and forget it. Just refill when needed. Cleaning is easy too. A+ all around."
62,Not too big but holds a good amount of water,I like the tray to put the oils on for the smell factor.  It holds water to last a couple of nights and has 3 different settings depending how much moisture you want. For a bedroom the low is good but a larger room could use the higher settings
63,Does the job,"It¡¯s great and does the job, only con is i find myself cleaning it everyday to s pic the buildup it gets dirty quick and i find it can end up having some hard to clean areas that can catch mold if you are not thorough and really getting into those crevices. Otherwise pretty good humidifier"
64,I didn¡¯t know how much I needed this,"I wanted a humidifier that was easy to clean and monitored the ambient humidity of the room- this one is a game changer. Easy to use the app, easier to clean, and I love that you can set the level of humidity and adapt based on season and needs. I have it on in my kids¡¯ room and it¡¯s perfect. You can slightly hear the ultrasonic, but that¡¯s not an issue for us since we run a sound machine at night."
65,"Set and forget humidifier, very easy and effective.","Turns on, goes into sleep mode and turns off all on schedule.  Tells me when it's run out of water and keeps me from waking up feeling dry."
66,Great Humidifier and Very Easy to Use.  Highly Recommend.,"Very easy to use.  I have it interfaced with Alexa and it works fine. First Humidifier I have owned that matches with my Humidity indicators across the room.  So far, highly recommend this product."
67,terrific humidifier,"easy to fill, easy to clean, no noise"
68,It works great butÿ,"This humidifier works great, but we have only had it for 4 months and the black ring in the bottom that puts our the mist, is already disintegrating. I haven¡¯t used anything abrasive to clean it, I gently clean it every other week with a rag or my hand. It¡¯s difficult to clean because all the crevices build up with minerals from the water. But aside from that, it works well and is quiet when it runs. I give it 3 stars."
69,"Extremely quiet and easy to use, love this Humidifier!!!",You will love this humidifier. You can be a foot away and not hear it running !
70,Moistened up the room very quickly.,It didn¡¯t take long before the room air had moisture back in it. Which made sleeping so much easier.
71,Great expectations; great disappointment,"Researched humidifiers well before choosing this one. Excellent instructions; cleaned as instructed. Within two months, stopped working: no misting. WiFi was quirky but it worked. Called and wrote company. Not taking calls and no response to emails. This was expensive enough to last at least a year. Very disappointed both in product and lack of customer service. Happily, Amazon refunded my money. LeVoit: boo! Amazon: yayyy!"
72,works great!,"quiet, not silent I say.  More of a hum.  Puts out plenty of mist.  Hold 3 liters I believe and in 24 hours it can go through that.  I put a small fan behind it blowing the moisture around a bit more and love it!"
73,Love it,Great
74,Very leaky,"Just received this about 4 hours ago.  Luckily I read reviews before setting this up, so I set a pan under it. It started leaking from the spring part almost immediately. No amount of jiggling or fanangling would get it to stop. It filled this pan twice, rather quickly, as the tank continued to just flow into the base, overflowing the base.
Very frustrating. I ordered two and am iffy on even opening and trying the second one, but at least Amazon makes returns pretty simple just in case that one leaks like this, too."
75,Very good,Very good humidifier quiet and nice
76,Cannot adjust to a higher humidity level,"The only complaint I have is I cannot adjust the humidity level above the default humidity level of 50%.  I like to keep the humidifier at about 57% so by the time it reaches my bed it is around 52%-53%.  Other than that it is a great machine, quiet, easy to clean. And I love the Bluetooth feature!"
77,Not impressive,"Major flaws, on high, with outside temperatures in the teens or below, it will not keep a bedroom at 50%.  You can not set it at a specific level, just low, medium, high and automatic (which is horribly inconsistent).  Noise level is better than average.  All in all, it may do what you need, but its biggest sin is how quickly red mold forms.  You may need to wash thoroughly with vinegar every three days, as I did - after being stunned by sore throat on days 4 & 5 a few times.  Other humidifiers I've had only had red mold like this has when I forgot a weekly wash and went two weeks.  And this has many more areas needing swabs and toothpicks than other humidifiers I've had.

I would discourage buying this, knowing you can do better for 1/3 to 1/2 the price, or spend a little more and get significantly more."
78,Operation,Good product
79,Controls?,"I'm not sure I understand the controls. You can adjust what I believe is the mist intensity but I don't think you can dial in a percentage and maintain it. You can power on and off, control a sleep mode?, and turn off or dim all lights but it looks like the humidifier just runs until it's out of water.

I just found that part. You have to switch to auto operation and the adjustment screen is hidden as a pop-up. Seriously.
It looks nice and spews out a visible mist (more like a fog) so it's doing what I intended and I'm sure it's too small to ever over do it.

In spite of the directions I would never put anything but distilled water in it. If I did I'd spend half an hour a week descaling it."
80,Super cool & easy to use,"Easy to use, clean, connected to wifi and my phone"
81,Very quiet and efficient,"Love this humidifier.  It's in the bedroom and is so very quiet.  It doesn't gurgle when water level changes, the sound when the device is on low speed is non existent.  I haven't tried any of the more advanced features so cannot comment on those.  But for taking it out of the box, filling with distilled water, plugging it in and turning it on at low speed..................it's met every expectation."
82,Does a great job of adding humidity to our front room. I can feel the difference.,I like the top filling for adding water. My wife can just add small amounts as opposed to having to remove & carry the tank. It is very quiet & on high speed adds about 2 gallons of water to the room in a 24-hour period.
83,"Super quiet, easy to clean, bad app to open functions","By far the quietest humidifier I ever owned. Never really get above 30% humidity, which is typical for every other humidifier I've had. Easy to clean. I love you can turn the display off with it on. The touch buttons on the machine work well. Unfortunately you have to use their app to get more functions out of it and its an ad riddled mess of an app and almost not worth using. If they had this same model without the app and more buttons on the machine I would prefer that."
84,Good humidifier.,This unit is easy to use and gives out a good mist. My only complaint is that the instruction booklet is printed with such small letters ( and very light contrast) that it was hard for me to read - even with a magnifier.
85,Shuts off in Sleep Mode,Occasionally the humidifier will shut off randomly when in sleep mode and it¡¯s not in auto either. Otherwise I absolutely love it and so does my cat.
86,Good Buy,For me this was well worth the money. The size was good & you won't be able to tell Its on since it's super quite
87,does exactly what I was looking for also totally silent in operation  easy  to fill and to operate,It is silent in operation.  It is easy to fill and to maintain.
88,Do not buy!,Leaking water all over the bedroom floor (wall-to-wall carpet!!!) What a waste...
89,Works like a charm!  and SILENT!!!,Makes absolutely no noise.  Within 2 days the humidity was improved - we have it in a large open family room / kitchen  / sunroom - works great!
90,Totally quiet which is important for a bedroom.,helps improve the environment in the bedroom which was too dry.
91,Pleasant surprise,"It¡¯s absolutely quiet in the bedroom, which was a pleasant surprise. Plus it puts out about 3/4 gal water mist  in 8 hours on automatic. Have had it ten days and haven¡¯t cleaned it yet cuz I¡¯m using purified water. I¡¯m very pleased so far. Price seemed fair too."
92,Uses an excessive amount of water,"With forced air, natural gas heat with a 42% automode setting in 12 foot by 15 foot room with 9 foot ceilings, this apparatus uses an excessive amount of water.  Your expenditure for distilled water in one month will exceed the cost of this humidifier. My unit did not include any extra sponge filters.  A box of replacement filters is insanely expensive for what they are.  I have noticed no health benefits from using this product.  The only benefit is the reduction in static.  I cannot recommend this product."
93,Great product,Love the app functions and reminders to clean. Works great. The option to add essential oils is also a nice touch. It¡¯s not over powering either. Would buy again
94,Be prepared to spend a fortune on distilled water,If you use tap water with this humidifier you get white dust all over the room. And into your furnace filters. I also got a persistent cough from the calcium and magnesium dust. I stopped using mine and will sell it.
95,Best humidifier I¡¯ve ever owned,This unit is really easy to clean. I live in a dry climate and I use the humidifier at night. It¡¯s quiet and efficient and got a high rating in The NY Times
96,Buy extended warranty,"It worked wonderful, then after a month it will stop unexpectedly. I have reached out, no response yet."
97,Great humidifier,Does the job and works great
98,Humidity level automatic setting,I like that the humidifier has a default humidity setting of 45% with an upper range of 50%.  It helps me sleep better at night.
99,Sent used and dirty product,"Bought this for my new baby, was sent a used and dirty product. Out of the box it was covered in dust, had water stains, and smelled of essential oils. Totally unacceptable for the price point. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it. Disappointing."
100,Must use distilled. Filter is not enough,I have a few others I use and don't have to use distilled water because they have great filters on them and remove the white dust effect. The filter on this is worthless. I like the machine otherwise but will be required to use distilled water which I don't have the time or the cares for.
101,Very good.,"Very helpful, we live it, no noise at all and looks good."
102,"Works well, efficient, difficulty cleaning.","I have really enjoyed my humidifier since I bought it. This is the first time I've really invested any money in a good humidifier, and I was pleased with how it ran. It looks nice, has a large enough tank for me, and keeps my plants happy. I have been thinking of buying 1-2 more to spread throughout my apartment.

However, I went to clean and descale my humidifier yesterday. I had to really take it apart to get all the scale off, since we have really hard water. Vinegar, a washcloth, paper towels, and q-tips did work fairly well to get it clean, but it was a long process. And by the end of it, the transducer plate was broken! I've now opened up the humidifier and removed the pieces of the transducer plate and the attached wires, and I'm really surprised by how fragile it is-- it doesn't surprise me that it broke as I was putting the humidifier back together. The humidifier now doesn't work, water leaks down into the base anyways, and a search for a new transducer hasn't turned anything up-- it would be nice if there were replacement parts I could order, as it isn't a complicated repair. I'm now trying to put the plate back together with some E6000, but I doubt this will work.

I'll be getting in touch with the company to see if I can get a replacement part, and will update my review accordingly."
103,Worked great until it decided to drain the entire tank of water on the floor,"This worked great for a month and 2 days, then once it was outside of Amazon's return window it leaked a full tank of water onto the floor.  Going in the trash now."
104,Great,Good
105,Best humidifier ever,"I have tried countless humidifiers trying to find the right one for my plants (and family lol). I love this humidifier so much I have purchased 4 of them to use throughout the house.

The automatic mode is great, I love being able to visually see the humidity levels, and the rotating spout lets you direct the mist without having to physically move the unit. Refill from the top! And it doesn¡¯t leave you with wet floors like some other units I¡¯ve tried.

It¡¯s hands down the best."
106,This is what I'm been looking for for a long time,"Changed several humidifiers in the past few years, none of them really made me satisfied. Either too noisy, or hard to clean even though they were not cheap at all. This is the perfect one. Powerful but quiet, and easy to clean. I'm very happy about it. Would recommend it to everyone."
107,No problems so far.,It seems to be working well. I actually bought it because of the Alexa integration but haven¡¯t actually turned it on.
108,Quiet and Efficient andÿ the APP makes it easy to access fro Anywhere..!!,Quiet and Efficient andÿ the APP makes it easy to access fro Anywhere..!!
109,Completely quiet.,This helps our air quality so much  It's quiet and shuts off automatically if it's out of water.
110,Pretty good product,"These are very quiet, works good with the app. The tanks could be bigger and the buttons on the base are hard to use. I have to do all the settings from the app. This is basically the only flaw."
111,Impossible to keep clean,"Everything about this product is excellent, except for cleaning it.  The unit must be cleaned often and it is a difficult task with lots of crevices'.  What a shame!"
112,Needs app to change humidity setting,The fact that this needs an app to change the humidity level is a deal breaker for me.  I tried it out but after a few days it would not connect to my wifi network anymore making this and other functionality useless.  This is a bad trend and  should not be supported.  Even if this device works for you now it very well may not in the future.
113,Useful Features,"Best humidifier I have ever owned by far. I have only owned the humidifier a few days. It is placed in my bedroom. As a retire I don't follow a schedule, so I haven't tried any programming. I turn it on at bedtime and off when I wake up. Just used it manually, and have not used all the features yet. I can say It is both quiet and economical. Still working on the water of the first tank fill after three nights."
114,Difficult to figure out unless you're good with apps and networks,"I'm 75, so notso good with apps, etc.  So when I couldn't turn the thing on right out of the box, and it was after call-in hours, I had to figure out how to download an app on my phone (including getting the apple ID and password right) and getting onto the home network (including getting the network IS and password right).

It took me more than an hour (though I was pleased with myself for getting it right.

I need to have more than 50% humidity for sleep, so I needed to be able to not use the 'smart' features, anyway.

What I think you should do it have an option for: just turn on and off, low, medium, and high.  I don't need my humidifier to be smarter than me (I already have to deal with that issue with my kids)."
115,Mold,Mold grows inside after a week. You will have to clean it every week to ensure it doesn¡¯t smell.
116,works well,i use this every day in our dry Michigan Winter weather. easy to use .has good features.
117,Great humidifier!!!,"I love this thing! It is so much easier to clean and use. I would totally recommend it and would buy again. The only downfall I see so far is that it is better suited for bedroom or used with another in larger spaces. It definitely doesn't cover 750sq ft.  Overall it is a great buy, well worth the price just for top fill alone."
118,The best,Humidifier works well and I love that is top loading. I can tell it what to do using my iPad or directly on the unit. It does not have the disturbing night lights which for some reason other humidifiers have which I found extremely annoying. So far so good!
119,Problems right out of the box,"No matter the water level it would not work for more than a few minutes without turning off and indicating to add water. Then one day it started working fine for no reason, I changed nothing. Then I wake up this morning and the tank is all spiderwebbed from the bottom up like it got to hot or something, now we're back to add more water. Junk..."
120,So far so good,Very quiet
121,Perfect for the bedroom,"Easy to use and setup. The wifi feature is nice as you can set reminders to clean it and setup the humidifier to come on before your going to bed to help get the rooms humidity level to what you prefer for sleeping. Can just barely hear a humming as it¡¯s running, has a night light built in to help give a soft glow to the surrounding area."
122,So Quiet and So Efficient,Using this humidifier in the bedroom. A much much better product than the last humidifier I had.
123,Perfect,I love that I am able to control this with my cellphone. No more dry skin in the winter.
124,"Nice, quiet humidifier","The aesthetics are Ok. Easy to fill, no drips or leaks whatever. Very quiet, even sitting next to it, the noise is just a whisper. In our 1200 sq foot great room it uses about 1.5 gallons/ day to raise the humidity from the lower 20¡¯s to mid 30¡¯s. We have been using it for about a month and are very happy with this purchase."
125,1 Star,Used for small bedroom. Doesn't help with the humidity level and gets very dirty after each use.
126,Leaks,"We've had this for 3 months. About a month ago, we noticed wet spots on the downstairs ceiling under this humidifier. I assumed I filled it wrong. Then I saw and it suddenly just started dripping down what it's sitting on. Now we need a humidifier and to paint the ceiling."
127,Dirty,Got moldy almost immediately
128,Humidifier,Great product and reliable
129,Don't do it.,This humidifier is only 3 months old. It leaked to the point that it bowed the wood of the dresser it was sitting on.
130,Excellent.,This thing pours water into the air.  Works very well.
131,Meh,"I wanted to be satisfied, but that's not the case, two weeks in and I am already having some troubleshooting issues. The only big win is that I don't have to constantly flip the water tank, I can just pour the water and it can run all night without having to fill it up every day"
132,Noice,It¡¯s works great
133,You have to fill the tank with distilled water,The product is great but it emits white dust if you use tap water which clogged 3 furnace filters in 3 weeks. Distilled water doesn't do this but it costs extra and you have to remember to buy it
134,Stopped working after one week,"Nicely sized water tank.  Unfortunately, humidifier only worked for a week."
135,A+,A+
136,Perfect,"Set up was extremely easy once I read the instructions lol. Press and hold the power button for 5sec. on initial setup - of course I kept holding it which performed a different function.  Outside of that, its perfect and easy. Quiet. I have mine set to auto with a specific humidity - its a small studio room with guitars. It shuts off and on as set, no issues and definitely improved my air quality as I have forced hot air - very dry.
Very happy with the purchase and the app. Just read instructions and follow them."
137,"Easy to use, very quiet","I was able to set this up within minutes. I love that it communicates with Alexa. This unit is extremely quiet, and produces a lot of humidity. A great buy."
138,Great humidifier,Great product. Easy to control humidity levels.
139,"Great product, great value",It¡¯s helped our entire home.
140,Spotty performance. Slow unresponsive (email) customer service!,"Purchased this from veSync¡¯s website. Worked fine for a week or so. Then it started to turn off without any reason, not having reached the set humidity level yet. I¡¯d turn it back on (either with the app or directly) and it would turn off again within minutes. Then it runs for days without a problem again. Pretty bad customer service all through email. It¡¯s been days since I sent them the pictures they requested of receipt, unit label and a shipping address. They haven¡¯t responded for seven days now!"
141,The phone app is a great feature and easy to use.,Very easy to fill with the lift-off lid. They are working great so far.
142,Great unit,"Easy to set up, it has an well designed app for setting timer and humidity level. Very quiet."
143,Quiet and easy to clean,"And when we contacted their support email for question about water filter, we received a reply with excellent detail.  Good CS, for this this date stamp."
144,Poor electronics!,"The on off button doesn't work well. Uou have to press it 6-8 times before it to work. I thought it was a fluke and asked for a replacement. Same thing, I sent it back again today."
145,Love this for my plants,It¡¯s quiet and raises humidity for my plants even through the dry winter.
146,Excellent Humidifier,"Bought this after master bedroom would regularly drop below 19% humidity according to my EcoBee3.  I have hard water in my home, so I started buying jugs of distilled water as recommended in the instructions.  What a difference!  The humidifier does an excellent job at keeping my room at my desired humidity levels.  It is virtually silent, and the night mode turns off the display making it perfect for use while asleep.

Before this, I've only ever used the $20 range humidifiers and after using this, I doubt it'll go back.  The app allows me to customize my desired level, as well as override if needed.  The push notifications letting me know when to clean / refill humidifier are big pluses as well."
147,"This item broke after 8 weeks of use, it is not made well!","Poorly built ""Made in China"" item that broke after minimal use."
148,Love love love,"Love that this device is a smart device. Let¡¯s me know when it¡¯s empty through an app notification, ability to set desired humidity % & will also shut off when it¡¯s 5% more than the desired %, reminds me to clean it, has a schedule, etc"
149,Good humidifier. Bad wifi connection.,"Overall great humidifier but I have been having constant wifi disconnections every since I got it which makes any customizations inaccessible unless you are connected. After Googling troubleshoots it turns out this is not an uncommon issue. Unfortunately all responses from Levoit point to it being everyones router problem and not an actual problem with their own product. The only real way of fixing it is unplugging it from the wall and plugging back in and if that doesn¡¯t work then you¡¯re SOL. I bought mine back in November so my return window has expired and I¡¯m stuck with a humidifier that doesn¡¯t have a working wifi.

Do yourself a favor and return this product immediately if you run into this issue."
150,Works well, Easy to setup
151,Really pleased with this!,I was pretty specific when looking for a humidifier. It was important to be able to schedule on/off times as this was for my office. So far (it¡¯s been two weeks) this has checked all the boxes. I was able to set up a schedule in the app with ease. The app sends me notifications when the water is out or when the room humidity is low. It¡¯s quiet and holds a good amount of water that lasts over multiple days. (I run it for 7 hours every day.) Recommended!
152,Don't buy it!,"I didn't believe the other reviewers.  This thing leaves white dust everywhere because I'm not using distilled water. At the rate I'm using it, that would be an extra $60 - $70 a month plus lugging gallons of water upstairs everyday.  There's too many tiny crevices that are a pain to clean every couple days with vinegar.  Also, I don't use the Alexa features.  I thought I would but since the thing runs 24/7, I haven't needed to.  I'll be looking for a different method to humidify my place next winter."
153,No Service after the sale,Trying to return 300s did not work as expected. Please send me a RMA so I can return for a refund. I have tried to return This item for days. Called their phone number message says use email. Then you wait. I do not want your humidifier I do not need. Please send me a RMA
154,Works great and is silent as the grave,"I needed a humidifier for my living room where most of my guitars are hanging on the wall. I live in NY where winter can get pretty dry and can be pretty damaging to them. I wanted something silent, had a large tank so I'm not constantly refilling it every day, and had an automatic humidity control so I don't have to keep checking the humidity level on my Google Nest thermostat and have to manually turn it on and off. This fit the bill perfectly. It has everything I wanted, and more. The app, which someone the reviews said was buggy and didn't work, is a great bonus. I'm not experiencing any problems with it. There, I can customize my humidity level, control the amount of mist, night light, and put it on a timer or sleep mode. It's actually a very convenient and useful app.

That being said, there are a few quirks I'm still working out. I noticed when I refill the tank and place it back into the unit, the humidity level on the digital readout on the front of the unit will spike. Sometimes going into the high 60s, which it definitely isn't. I'm wondering if I'm dripping water onto the sensor when I place the tank back on the unit. I'll have to figure out where the sensor is and try to remedy it.

Second, I saw a few reviews stating it produces a white film on everything in the room where it's working, and that seems to be true. But this isn't the fault of the unit. That white film is minerals in your water. If you're using tap water, you'll likely have this white film. And if the unit is running quite a bit on a dry day, it can actually cause there to be a haze in your home, almost like you burnt toast and there's a haze from the smoke. The company recommends using distilled water and I think I'm going to try that out. I'm sure it's not dangerous being that it's just minerals, but it just looks bad and is annoying to have to dust everything in a week of use.

Other than those two small problems, it's a great unit for the price. It's almost completely silent, has a nice big tank opening so cleaning it is a breeze, and it's well made. I like this brand a lot."
155,Powerful humidifier!,"It came pretty quickly. I was pretty impressed with the misting power of this humidifier.  I'm actually thinking of buying another one, So I definitely recommend this one worth the money"
156,Great machine,Excellent product. Excellent app
157,Fragrance diffuser,I bought these humidifiers for the diffuser component. I applied the oil as directed. There is no smell. Don't buy this if you want the fragrance feature.
158,The worst product (by far) I have ever purchased though Amazon,"The humidifier and software worked well for 3 days, although the only command Alexa understood was ""on"" and ""off."" Every single other command was declined by Alexa. Of course, after 3 days, the humidifier disconnected itself from my WIFI and could never again be connected.

But if you intended to equip your home with many products using VeSync (as I did), this is a good one to buy. In the long run, it will save you loads of money because you will never again buy another product using this incredible awful software."
159,This thing never quits!,"This is the third humidifier I purchased within 4 months. I tried a couple of tower style humidifiers and they just didn't last. They both went back within a month. I've had this unit for a couple of months now and leave it running 24/7 and it has never faltered. It's easy to fill, the opening is big enough to get my hand in for cleaning and it's super quiet. I also like how you can turn the control panel off at night but also that there is a softer night light feature if you want it. I also have not had any issues with the app or spam emails from the company."
160,Great while it lasted,"The app was nice because it notifies you when it's needs to be cleaned and filled and controlling the settings was easy.  They should have put more thought into the motor design, though. It only lasted a couple months before it stopped working."
161,"So far, so good!","Just started using this humidifier. So far, so good!"
162,Very convienient to use with app,I like the app which could set schedule to turn it on or off
163,White dust everywhere,The instructions RECCOMND using distilled water. This is because if you dont it will vaporize the minerals in the water and leave a sticky white dust everywhere in the room. I also noticed a cough develop that hurts fairly well after using this thing.
164,Quiet and efficient,"Unit works well, is quiet and efficient. I haven't had to clean it yet. Filling is something of chore, and you need to use filtered or distilled water. Humidified air seems to help sleep too."
165,Stopped functioning after 2 months of use,"Loved the product at first. After two months, it stopped putting out an adequate amount of mist and was unable to humidify the room."
166,Better control,Control buttons not easy to operate
167,love,super quiet & easy to use. had to pour a lot more than 6 drops into the essential oil pad but after you soak it its fine.
168,Im giving this a honest rating my shuts off on its own !!,"Even with it filled under the fill level and aligned with the arrows on the base and everything correct no setting set for scheduling it JUST SHUTS OFF ON ITS OWN MABYE MINE IS DEFECTIVE,  IF IT STAYED RUNNING ID GIVE IT 3 OR 4 STARS MABYE BUT IM VERY DISAPPOINTED AND TRYING TO GET HELP IM DIRECTED TO ANOTHER COUNTRY WITH SOMEONE I CAN HARDY UNDERSTAND AND THAT ACTS LIKE IDK WHAT IM DOING I HAVE SEVERAL HUMIDIFIERS. IDK BOUT THIS ONE."
169,Really puts out mist.,"Easy to use. Great, fine mist so you get the benefit without damp surfaces. Mist stays suspended in air. Various levels are noticable."
170,Overall Good Quality,Really good product. App needs more functionality.
171,Nice item.,Good quality item.  Works as designed.  Alexa control is a bonus.
172,Don't buy this!,I filled it up and plugged it in. As soon as I turned it on all of the water leaked out. I called customer service and the talked me through setting it up. (There was nothing new from following the instructions the first time) I plugged it in and turned it on again and all the water leaked out. I'm returning it.
173,Perfect size - works great!,Easy to fill. Very quiet and do not even notice it running.
174,Quiet!,"I love this thing is super quiet, even on high. We burn wood for heat and it really dries out the house. This makes for a nice, tropical feel when on high so mid-level is about perfect.  And I can run it from my phone."
175,Connection With Alexa Does Not Work,"One of the main reasons I chose the LEVOIT humidifier is because of the advertised ability to link with Alexa.  Unfortunately , that seems to be broken.  The linking process ends with being dumped to a website that just says ""Index of /"" then a file name.  This process is broken."
176,You need to clean it very often,"I like its design, look neat and modern. Noise level is acceptable, you can barely hear it. I keep it on most of the time since I have babies in the room and the heat is always on. This machine is definitely not so easy to clean. The water stink needs to be cleaned almost every three days or so."
177,Last almost 3 nights on one tank fill!  Great App...,"This humidifier is one of the best I have owned.  It's super easy to fill from the top, easy to clean, and very, very quiet.  The Wi-Fi connection to their APP is amazingly easy to use.  Overall, I would recommend this humidifier."
178,Great,Good
179,Very good product extremely recommended,I like this product
180,They have a great support system for their products.,I had an issue with my humidifier and Elijah in support was awesome in solving all my problems.
181,No Help In The Desert,"I live in the middle of the Mojave desert and my small living room has RH in the single digits. I was hoping this would bring RH up to 30%. After running on high for a whole day, the best it would do is 20%. Not good enough for the hassle of running it and the white dust left behind. I gave it 2 stars because it is very quiet, but otherwise it's like spitting into the wind. So, back to Amazon it goes. The only humidifier that works in the desert is the swamp cooler in the summer. Lesson learned!"
182,Quiet and Easy!,It¡¯s in our bedroom so I wanted one that operates quietly and this is the best (I tried 2 others).  Easy to fill. Sleep mode (so turns any lights on it off but still runs). It is set to auto and I just let it do it¡¯s thing.
183,KEEP SAYING ADD WATER BUT THERE IS STILL A LOT OF WATER,KEEP SAYING ADD WATER BUT THERE IS STILL A LOT OF WATER. WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP
184,Love it!,"I have owned several of these over the years - and I think this is the best version of them all. Easy to clean, easy to refill - it works."
185,This is really a good humidifier.,"The top fill feature is the most important to me. It takes just a minute to pour from the pitcher into the container section. It can go all day with 1 fill even with the house heat on and the vapor output on the unit on ""High""- I live in the northeast so that is amazing to me. There's no running sound at all. I have a fan on the plant table next to the unit and that's proved valuable to move moisture-laden air to a wider area quicker. I haven't washed it yet so can comment on that. I really like this product!"
186,Best purchase!,Hubby and I were each running two small ones on our night stand.  Decided to switch to Levoit and love it.  Don¡¯t have the wet felling in the air and you don¡¯t wake up to dry.
187,Perfect - except for the bright display,"Except for the extremely bright display, we could not have picked a better humidifier for our home. Quiet, effective, maintains perfect humidity, easy to refill and clean, and very light and easily moved to another location. But, if you¡¯re planning on keeping it in a bedroom/adjoining room, you will have to turn off the display unless you like sleeping in a well-lit room OR you will have to get out of bed and physically turn off the display on the device itself.  I would still buy it again."
188,Works well easy to use,"Perfect design, can give commands with iPhone, works well , hardly any noise - sleeping mot a problem. It also looks very nice. I haven¡¯t cleaned it yet but found a utube video going through cleaning so I¡¯m all set. I highly recommend it."
189,Working as expected for 3 months now,No water Leake as some review says. Super quiet. Happy with the purchase. I only add water once every 2 days and runs over the night.
190,So far so good,First one was defective and kept leaking. Replacement one has been good so far. (3days) I like that the lid comes completely off for easy cleaning. Large tank so I haven¡¯t needed to refill it yet. I also like the nightlight and that the display can turn off for better sleep.
191,I LOVE THIS THING!,"I'm in a large one bedroom apartment, so I've got one in the kitchen, one in the dining room 20' away, and the hygrometer half way inbetween shows around 35% rh with both the units on auto.

And I've been keeping my thermostat a couple degrees lower since I got them;  I forgot that dry environments make you feel colder.

BTW, the perfect companions are the ThermoPro TP50 Digital Hygrometer and the Amazon Basics 3-Quart Tritan Farm to Table Pitcher to fill them."
192,Super quiet,Works great but on off button very sensitive-  it turning in easily
193,Good humidifier,"Giving 3 stars, as it has nice output. Auto mode becomes useless since humidistat is messed up and I really have no clue why after unit shuts off humidistat reading starts going up by 15-17% ???
**********************
UPDATE
After couple of hours of work humidistat got back to normal and unit is working ok now, the reason I¡¯m giving only 4 stars is the night light is limited to single color only"
194,Very effective and quiet,This works very well to keep the humidity level in the desirable range. Very quiet and easy to use.
195,I bought this to replace 2 smaller adequate units and it¡¯s the best decision I¡¯ve made in a while,Wi-Fi enabled and easy to connect to Alexa.  Once the humidit level is set it does shut off when the level is reached. Basically it does everything describes bed efficiently and holds enough water that it doesn¡¯t constantly need refilling.
196,Super quietÿ when it works.,The product is very wonky. My old Venta would just pump out humidity. This one has lights and an app and tells you the humidity but doesn¡¯t actually work. Turns off for no reason. Says there is no water in the tank when the tank is full. It¡¯s a piece of junk lol.
197,Love it,Great easy to use. I suggest you use blue tooth to set it up first. Will make connecting to the internet much easier. The app is easy to use. I¡¯m thinking about adding a second one for my living room. With the dry air here
198,Works amazing,I had to give it not a perfect review because how hard it is to clean. And it¡¯s gross too once a week I clean this. And it¡¯s this yellowish/orange mucus looking slim. To actually clean inside and out is a process. It¡¯s in hard to reach places and doesn¡¯t easily come off. Honestly the first time I cleaned it I almost got sick
199,"This is a very nice unit. It's quiet, simple to refill and very effective. Great for my guitar room!",A+ Great product!
200,"Quiet, holds a lot of water, difficult to clean","My allergist recommended a humidifier to address a recurring sinus issue and, after reading reviews and ""best of"" lists, selected this.  The footprint is large and I wish I could direct the angle as well as the direction of the vapor mist.  Not a show-stopper by any means, but that would have been a plus.  This unit is very quiet and the night mode leaves the room completely dark which is a good feature.  I don't use the smart app as something just doesn't seem about using my phone to control a small appliance.  I was surprised that a unit of this size is unable to bring the humidity in my bedroom above 42%; yes, it's winter and I have forced air natural gas heat, but I was expecting rain forest, water dripping from the ceiling kind of capability.  No risk of any denizens of the Amazon taking up refuge at my place.

The videos indicated that it was easy to fill, just remove the tank and fill.  Even when the unit is completely empty, there is still enough residual water to cause the tank to drip on table and floor when removed.  I chose to just fill it with a 1-gallon pitcher.

The real negative is the complexity of the cleaning - watch a video of the recommended ""tear down"" for cleaning when considering your purchase.  If you harbor a fetish for small parts and little spongy filters, this may not be a problem.  The owner's manual recommends that you do this 1x per week - even the threat of Legionnaires' disease won't make that happen.  Has to be a better way...."
201,Stopped working after the third use.,I am very disappointed with the quality of this product. It stopped working after the 3rd use. Would not recommend.
202,This Works,It holds a good amount of water. The phone app does just what you need and none of it is any more complicated than it needs to be. Setting up a schedule for sleeping  and topping it off every few days couldn't be easier. I'm sold.
203,Very quiet. Like the top fill instead of having to turn a unit upside down,I have this on a nightstand table so it can reach the whole room
204,Best Designed Ultrasonic Humidifier,"As a designer I can be really appreciate the thought and effort they put into this product. Everything from the app features (no light night mode, Alexa/Google integrations that work) to the physical design such as top fill, the fact that the tank stands in a sink and that its parts are way easier to clean than the 5 other models of humidifiers I have experienced with.  The capacity and auto mode really make a huge difference if you're upgrading from a dumb model. You won't regret this one."
205,Makes lots of vapor!,Makes lots of vapor and only have to fill every 24 hours
206,Works well.,Large enough reservoir to provide steam over 12 hours.
207,Only but if you want to install an app to use.,"Disappointed. Positives are that it¡¯s extremely  quiet and easy to refill.
However the negatives outweigh any positives. You can not set a humidity level any higher than 50% unless you install an app. No thank you. The touch screen on the humidifier is unresponsive at times. The unit shuts off randomly even when set to high."
208,Best humidifier ever. A + Great Features,It¡¯s great. Worth the higher price. So happy I bought it. Use every chance I get. Live in in desert and it¡¯s so dry. Huge help A+++
209,Broke Before I Could Even Set It Up + Needs Distilled Water,"I read some reviews saying that the water leaked out all over the place but I thought they just must not know what they are doing or set it up wrong; but nope, the exact same thing happened to me. It didn't just leak it freaking flooded my floor before I could even plug it in.

ALSO a word to the wise- they don't make it very clear but this can only be run using distilled water so make sure you have some handy before setting it up."
210,Loved it so much I bought a second one,"I bought one initially for my newborn son and when he moved to his own room, the humidifier followed. Soon after, I noticed a huge increase in my skin dryness since the humidifier was no longer in my room. I solved that problem by buying a second one for me. Highly recommend and very satisfied with the 300S product. I love that it has an optional nightlight feature. It¡¯s also very easy to clean. I¡¯ve owned many humidifiers that ended up being big pains to clean and descale, not the case with this one."
211,"Quiet , large tank and easy to clean",It¡¯s been very cold this winter and this humidifier works great. Can¡¯t hear it at all. I also like that you can turn off all the lights. I would buy another one.
212,Doesn't have any apparently effect on humidity in medium-sized open room,"I got this because it was highly rated in a NYT Wirecutter article.

I'm guessing this would be fine for a small, closed room. But in our living room, it has no apparent impact on humidity. We have one of those little weather stations within 3 feet of the humidifier, and the interior humidity as measured by that station doesn't change at all whether we use the humidifier or not.

Our living room is it huge, but it's also open to a hallway and a stairway to a loft, so maybe that makes the space too big to be affected by this unit.

So, try it in a very small room that can be shut off from the rest of the house by closing a door."
213,Upper basin leaks at material seam,"There was a leak where the clear material meets the white material near the humidifier tube on the upper basin which causes a constant stream of water thus overflowing the lower basin. You can have almost the whole thing running out on your floor, table, bookshelf, etc."
214,It produces sufficient moisture,"I have a larger Levoit I use downstairs to balance out the dryness caused by our gas fireplace.  This one looks just as easy to clean and has adjustments to position the spray.  Im happy with it¡¯s function, however, I did encounter difficulty when downloading and using the app to control it.  For one,  there seems no way to change the ¡°target¡± level of  moisture. It¡¯s auto set to 50%.

It seemed at first I was able to raise it to 53% but after installing the app that setting could not be found and any related FAQ¡¯s were not helpful or clear at all!  Im going to work with it a bit more before I contact the company.  I may just delete the app and use the manual approach as I do the larger downstairs Levoit unit.

The unit works well though, has convenience settings but like most technology nowdays, they make it more complicated with app controls."
215,Great for use during the winter and easy to use!,This product is great and the smart features allow for easy adjustment on the fly.  The sleep feature is great and allows for a long use time between filling the water resevoir.
216,"Quiet, Efficient and well worth the price","I purchased this humidifier because the air here in Colorado can become quite dry. It keeps my humidity at 45 percent with no problem.
I am quite happy with this purchase."
217,Just about perfect,"Sleep is much better and more comfortable thanks to the work of this humidifier, which is effective and virtually silent, and offers several control options.  A five-star rating also goes to the Levoit customer service team, who, when we did encounter a problem, worked quickly and courteously to resolve the issue."
218,Good but cold,I use this for my bedroom and it does lower the room temperature so be prepared for a cooler room. Goes through a lot of water but does humidify the air more
219,Controls on the machine dont work,I returned the first one because the controls didnt work. Got a new one and its doing the same thing. I was able to control it with the app so I didnt return again. Now that isnt working either
220,This was my third different Levoit and it looks like it's going back also,"The humidity indicator is nuts, I would be in a cloud if it was 60%, my regular hygrometer says 37%. On AUTOMATIC it starting going up to 69% so I run it on HIGH, the AUTO control was one of the reasons I got this one. This is my third different Levoit the other two have gone back with readings of out of water when it was full and shutting off for no reason. The other one had all sorts of hygrometer problems. My advice DON'T BY ONE OF THESE."
221,Quiet and efficient.,Have been using the humidifier daily for about 2 weeks now.  Very quiet and simple to use.  Have not tried out any of the smart features yet.
222,Not worth it,I bought this in November but didn't start using it until Christmas. It stopped working February 11 2022 Reread the instructions dumped it cleaned it and still doesn't work and of course it was after the return date You live and learn. I only hope the smaller one I have of the same make doesn't go out also
223,great humidifer,"works great, humidifer has auto-off and auto-on feature, seems to work well with the phone app. no complaints.

note: make sure to use distilled water, or the atomizer may clog with minerals. super important!"
224,"Super Quiet, lots of mist","This unit is really good for our large bedroom. I personally don't like the fact that during ""sleep mode"" it sets the unit to auto, which turns off the unit at 50%. Most times I turn it back on in the morning, and it is showing around 38-40% which makes me curious how the auto mode works. Or if it runs on a timer. The large tank is nice. lasts around 36 hours of continued use."
225,Love it!,"Works great, not hard to clean, and very quiet!!"
226,Improved my sleep,Puts out so much humidity! Great for dry winters!
227,Great Factory Support,"The rated room size for this unit is very liberal. I use it in a 10x10 ft office and it works fine. In a 20x20ft room it is inadequate. For a larger room you would need at least 2 units and maybe more. A positive is it is easy to maintain and clean. My unit started to act up and did not work properly. I emailed support from the company and explained in detail the problem, they sent a replacement to me within 3 days. Excellent!!"
228,how well it works,it work's great ...it's quite and does a great job
229,This is not quite at all!!!!!,"I have had this for 2 days now and it is going back! It is not quite at all!!!! This thing sounds like an electric toothbrush but even louder. I can't get the dang thing to turn off I have to manually unplug it. Also when it runs out of water it did not turn itself off.

I do love the wide open top for easy cleaning."
230,"Very good and quiet humidifier, but better for smaller room.","I would highly recommend this humidifier for people with smaller rooms! Before I gave my pros and cons below, I would like to give my experience with the built-in hygrometer.

I saw many people complaining and got frustrated about the inaccuracy of the hygrometer, I had the same issue when I just put it on the ground at first. But once I lift it up, it is more accurate than before, but I would admit it is still not as accurate as a real hygrometer. For those people who want to count on the built-in hygrometer, I would highly recommend you to put it on top of a coffee table or a chest drawer. Okay, then let's take a look at my pros and cons:

Pros:
1. Super quiet! I think this is the quietest humidifier I have ever used.
2. Very easy to refill. You can either open the lid to refill water, or you could take the water tank with you and refill the water. Either way, it is super easy, but I would recommend the 1st method, since you won't drop water everywhere.
3. Good design and very easy to use.

Cons:
1. Even though I don't think the hygrometer is as bad as someone said in their review, it is definitely not accurate all the time. It would be great if it could be improved in the future.
2. A little design flaw on the sleep mode and ""screen off"" function. I cannot keep the fan speed at high, and also keep the led screen off. This might be linked to the 1st point cons.
The only way to turn off the screen is to choose the ""sleep"" mode, but the fan speed will be changed to ""auto"" by default. Since the auto mode depends on the hygrometer, and it is not accurate all the time, I would suggest to have a single function to turn off the led screen.

Overall, I am not too bothered by those 2 little cons, I would highly recommend this product!"
231,Better sleep,"My wife and i were dying to get this. Procrastinated the purchase then left it in the box for days. Later, tomorrow, later. Well, later never comes. We set it up and the only regret is not having done it sooner. We both slept much better from the very first night. The hardest part of the set up is getting started and not waiting for later. Our grandkids sleep with the same one and they love it."
232,humidity effects,"After thoroughly investigating my needs, reading it's description, it's attributes, and the positive reviews, I assumed I was purchasing an excellent humidifier. Now maybe mine is slightly faulty (I have never owned a humidifier) but it touted it would humidify a 500' sq/ft room to approx 40%-50%.  I figured there could be variations in the testing and what is in the room so I wouldn't be too bothered @ 38%-52%.  So I have a room that is 316' sq/ft  but I am presently looking at 25%35% (fluctuations is more towards 26%-33% with mean average of 28% in room temp 22c-23c) humidity in the room that I assure is well insulated and not airy!! without the humidifier I was looking at 20%-25% on average (again I did some testing so I had a better idea of what I needed. Plus it had a run time on a full tank of 48hrs. I have seen maybe a little over half of that (30-35hrs). So I am purchasing another humidifier and probably going with same company because other than discrepancies in humidification  and run time, it seems like a well constructed appliance. I believe I will be purchasing a Levoit LV600HH, BUT I will probably send them both back if the second one doesn't live up to the description that I read about."
233,Good reviews,Nice and quiet. Controls are easy to use and easy to clean. Great reviews and I can see why. We¡¯ll built and reputable company.
234,!  Would be happier if the tank seated a little deeper into the base when carrying the unit!!,See comment above!
235,Recommended for Sonic Bedroom,This mushine is similar to AC. It can do a lots of things as mentioned in the description. I will be putting Sonic pictures or stickers to make it nice like Sonic the Hedgehog.
236,Hangover cure?,"Like many people around the world I found myself drinking more at home during the global pandemic (Covid 19).  Sometimes I would wake up feeling sluggish and a headache.  Well anyone will tell you hangovers can be caused by dehydration. That¡¯s where the LEVOIT Hummidifiers for Bedroom, Large Room Home comes in!  After making an effort to drink in moderation, eat healthy food, excercise, drink more water, and putting this humidifier in my bedroom; I¡¯ve noticed a huge improvement in how I feel!

I hope I used that semicolon correctly.

Anyway, this humidifier is top rated for a reason.  It¡¯s quiet, easy to maintain, and the built in hygrometer monitors your home environment so you don¡¯t have to. The design is unobtrusive to any decor.  It kind of looks like a medical gumball machine, and I¡¯m okay with that!

Keeping your home humidity is great for house plants. Also like many of you I happen to own a solid mango wood concert sized ukulele (handmade in Hawaii).  Obviously this beautiful instrument is sensitive to dry air and wide swings in humidity. I posted a photograph.  I normally don¡¯t keep my ukulele so close to the Levoit humidifier.  I don¡¯t want it to be directly sprayed.

I read the manual cover to cover.  There are detailed instructions on where to (and where not to) add essential oils if that¡¯s your jam.  I thought a tropical beta fish would look nice in the clear tank.  Nowhere in the manual does it say not to keep fish in the humidifier, but I would recommend against it.

Note: if you also have a levoit air purifier these clever appliances will fight each other.  If my humidifier is humidifying then the air purifier detects the mist and goes full speed trying to clean the air.  So I can only use one machine at a time depending on what issue I more urgently need to address."
237,It¡¯s decent.,Gets dirty fast. The humidity monitor is not accurate. There should be a remote with a reader or separate monitor that you can place in the room. Also my biggest complaint is there isn¡¯t an option for warm mist humidifier setting which is the cleanest air option. Sad they missed the mark on that. Aside it¡¯s a nice size tank and cranks out the water.
238,Better than expected,"I thought, well...how cool can a humidifier be? Well, I am pleasantly surprised. The app is pretty good, although filled with some extra stuff. But, controlling the humidifier is great. I really love the scheduling. As long as I keep the humidifier filled with distilled or filtered water, it should last quite some time. I'm very happy with this humidifier."
239,Well made,Like very much accept controls a bit difficult to work with.
240,Awesome product,"The app is great, easy to use, the humidifier doesn¡¯t make any noise and the night mode is excellent no lights and if needed, this humidifier has a nightlight as well"
241,It's quiet and works well,"Not much to say here.  This is an easy to use product that was simple to set up, is quiet and works well.  Highly recommend it."
242,Low output but quiet,"I've never used the app with it, yet even on the manual high setting I can't get out ~300sqft bedroom above 39/40%. Would not recommend and definitely wish I sent it back after the first couple nights.
The tank fully lifts out and fills from the top, which is convenient to fill with a jug or just set in the sink for a RO system, but annoying bc it drips on the floor as you carry it to the sink.
It does get 5 stars for how quiet it is and that it can run with truly zero lights on!"
243,Very good humidifier.,"Very quiet, easy to fill. High capacity."
244,Humidistat not very accurate,Humidistat reads 58% while hallway thermometer reads 8%. Large difference. Love how quiet it is.
245,As a humidifier it works great except when it leaks all over your very expensive floors,so I purchased this with the expectation that it wouldn¡¯t have the same issue that others had. There was a few reviews saying that it has a tendency to leak the whole 5 L all over the place. Well we purchased it and it ran great for a long time and then one day I filled it put it on top of the bass and about 40 minutes later realized that it had leaked all 5 L all over my expensive wood floors. Discovered that the float that opens up the valve that puts water into the base sometimes it gets stuck open even though it¡¯s supposed to close when there¡¯s water enough water in it. But alas it happened again in my very expensive wood floors are now sopping wet and the green is puffing up. So if you plan on buying this humidifier that¡¯s great the app works it works it¡¯s not that bad except you have to use the app to use any of the features.  But make sure every time you put water in it that you double check to make sure the flow is freely moving and not stuck in the open position. Or you¡¯ll have 5 L of water all over your floors. Overall review two stars max
246,Great smart humidifier overall,"I love this humidifier so much I got a second for my other room. I have way too many houseplants and these humidifiers have made a big difference in maintaining the right growing conditions for my babies.

Pro: the scheduler, cleaning/empty tank notifications, and the automatic mode are all incredible features.

Con: the built-in humidity sensors  are a little slow to refresh. I set external sensors around the room for testing, and the built-in sensors were off by up to 5-10%. But they usually catch up with the other sensors within a few minutes."
247,False advertising,"Does not work with alexa, totally false advertising. You have to control the devise through a 3rd party app that sends you spam mail, I didn't even turn it on when I found this out. It doesn't matter how good the product is because of how dishonest the company is. Also shame on Amazon for supporting such dishonesty."
248,Great humidifier!,I upgraded to this larger model and really like it!  Highly recommend and also like that it can be filled from the top!  Essential oil is a nice bonus!
249,Good product.,"I bought this to add humidity to our living room.  We have a whole house humidifier on our furnace, but the humidity in this room just needed a boost.  This is just the ticket.  Word to the wise, pay attention the recommendation to use distilled water.  I first filled it up with tap water that is softened by a water softener. Thought maybe that was enough.  After one tank I realized this wouldn't work.  Had white ""dust"" around the humidifier.  Cleaned it up, cleaned the humidifier, and filled it with distilled water.  Lesson learned.  Works great and no more dust."
250,Great humidifier with a sleep cycle glitch,"Love it overall but keep having challenges with the display that keeps turning on regardless sleep mode being turned on. Can¡¯t figure it out. Other than that it is quiet, easy enough to clean, i like the app for reminders. Highly recommended distilled water - reduced the white film my tap water produced to absolute minimum."
251,Love it.,I always need a humidifier in the winter so I have used several different models/brands.  This is my all time favorite.  Would definitely purchase it again.
252,the app requires location to be on to setup.  completely unnecessary.,"the humidifier works great.  There is no warm mist feature on this humidifier so the noise level is very very quiet.  I typically set about 8 feet away and I cannot hear the humidifier.  The app requires you to turn on your phone's location to set it up.  Fortunately after setup you can turn off location and it is still useable.  Completely unnecessary to require location.  So just know this app is likely collecting as much data off your phone as possible in order to make more money.

The main function of the app (turning it off and on and adjusting the humidity)  is hidden and has to be swiped up once you get to the page of the humidifier.  instead, on the main page of the humidifer is a bunch of useless feel good stuff about your location."
253,Quiet & easy to use,I love how quiet it is. I like that you can set the level of humidity to what you want. It isn't the easiest to clean but I would definitely recommend it to others. So easy to use.
254,Great Purchase,Super quiet and easy to use. This product has helped with my constant dey nose and mouth every morning. App is easy to use as well.
255,Best I ever had,"So no far, 2 months in, everything is perfect."
256,great humidifier,"I had a previous generation, but this one is sooo much better.  I love the way I can pull it off, and not have to unscrew a filter anymore.  Just take the top off and fill it."
257,Solved my issues.,Easy to maintain and delivers without the moisture issues of steam vaporizers.
258,Easy to clean,This humidifier has a large tank for water and easy to fill it up and clean it. It¡¯s easy with the phone to handle it .
259,This humidifier in one month left a white layer of film all over my entire house,This humidifier in one month left a white layer of film all over my entire house. And that means I was breathing this in for a whole month
260,Best one,I use it everyday. Never even know it is on. Alexa use is great.  Big tank and easy to clean. Best ive ever had worth the price
261,Easy to fill,Love the app control and the alert messages
262,I love mine,"I love mine, I use it all the time and it will last all day and through almost the next day. Worth the money."
263,Hard to figure out..,"Works, great goes through a lot of water. But setting the humidity percentage is rather confusing. Even on the app there is confusion. There is night mode where the ""target"" humidity is 45%, I am in Denver, that's almost impossible. So it will go through over half a tank a night trying to get that45%. It also has ""mist Level"" setting that doesn't seem to coincide with the target humidity...?"
264,Great product,I¡¯m very satisfied with this humidifier. I can control it with the app on my phone if I¡¯m not home. You can also turn off the lights on the device.
265,It¡¯s okay BUT,"I really liked the product when I first got it, HOWEVER now that I¡¯ve had it for a month I¡¯ve been constantly fighting with this product to get it to work. Everytime I turn it on 5 mins late it says the tank is empty when I can assure it has plenty of water. Sometimes I can get it to work and others I have to turn it on 5 times in a row. When the product works it¡¯s not bad by any means but I can¡¯t get it to work. Spend money elsewhere it¡¯s not worth the risk"
266,GREAT WHEN IT WORKS,"when it is running and connected to your phone it's GREAT!.....BUT  BUT I have such a hard time connecting the device, phone and network. would have been 5 stars but trouble connecting. Another problem(huge) is the fact that you can only contact customer help via email.....that is a big negative!"
267,"Simple, functional, quiet and powerful","Easy, simple, functional, doesn¡¯t need constant refills even in dry Montana.  Really puts out tons of moisture and is almost overkill on medium in a bedroom.  High gets the room well above 60 percent RH even in a room with 10-15 % RH!  Super quiet, maintenance seems to be minimal and I just dump regular tap water in it."
268,Defective,"Worked great for a few days. Third or fourth time I filled it up, it started leaking water out of the bottom and spilled everywhere. The problem was a defective plastic pin that regulates water flowing from the tank into the base. It¡¯s a custom part and there was no way to repair it, so I had to return it. I will be looking for something higher quality."
269,"After a Few Starts and Stops, I Finally got the Unit and the App to Work Together","After some trial and error,  I got it working.  The app at first would disconnect from the unit for no apparent reason and I could not get the connection with the Google Assistants to work.  But I finally got it all to come together and I am impressed.  Nice to have the app to schedule a preferred time to turn the unit on and off.  And I can say, ""Hey Google"" and it listened and did what I asked.  Very nice!!"
270,So far so good,"Have been using this humidifier for about a week. So far so good. It's normally set to ""Auto"" mode. Very quiet machine. Easy to clean. Easy to add water."
271,"good, but humidity settings could be better","Overall, I like this humidifier so far.  My biggest complaint is the humidity setting.  I bought this one so I could set a desired humidity setting.  The humidity reading seems to be fairly accurate, but you cannot set it very precisely.  The way it works, you can set your desired humidity, but it doesn't kick on until the humidity drops 5% below the target humidity and then it stays on until it is 5% above the target.  I wish it would only go up to the target and kick on if it is a little below the target.  This would be a great update to the app.  Its been easy to clean, but I haven't done a deep clean which they recommend once a week with white vinegar.  I haven't been using distilled water, I've been using filtered tap water which has been working out well so far.  It is quite and was easy to set up and use, but you do have to download the app if you want all the features available to you."
272,Leaked after a couple of months!,"I was very happy with the humidifier initially. Quiet, worked very well for 3 months - best one I had ever purchased (I thought).  I walked into the bedroom the other day and the bedroom carpeting and furniture under the unit were completely soaked. All the water had leaked from the unit. It took days to completely dry the area. I tested to see if it would occur when it was not turned on and the same occurred. There are no cracks, nothing wrong that I can see.  Very disappointed and of course I'm past the return window of time.."
273,Piece of crap,"Received item. Followed setup directions,  once plugged  in the display just blinks and the unit won't work.. waste  of my time...don't buy"
274,Works pretty good for small space,"This unit is reasonably priced and works well. It has Bluetooth functionality and is easy to setup and use with your phone. Filling is easy as well. Just keep in mind that this will do very little to ad humidity to an entire house or apartment. Considering that the water tank filled to the top will last a out a day (compared to the humidifier on my furnace that uses two gal per hour) It is more suitable for a single room the size of a bedroom, or grow tent. It has an ""auto"" feature which shoots for a 47% humidity, and low, med, high. Also a timer feature. All in all, it works well as long as you don't expect to much from it."
275,"simple, easy to use and very effecient","transparent; you can see water level, efficient; humidity improved dramatically and most wonderful thing is the App !!"
276,Automatically Turns to Auto Mode at Nigth,"We were pleased with this humidifier at first, but then it started automatically switching from night mode (which is dark) to auto mode, which is bright enough to wake us up, over and over again all night long. Multiple trouble-shooting attempts did not fix it. Amazon was kind enough to refund us for the humidifier. Choose a better model!"
277,Super quiet!,Liked that this unit will shut off automatically when humidity level gets between 40 and 50 percent.
278,Didn't work well out of the box,"Not happy with my purchase so far. Followed the setup directions and humidifier shut off several times in the first 3 hours of use. I'm going to give it a couple days, will update if I keep it send it back.

*Update (2/16/22) - Humidifier still not working correctly, I'm sending it back."
279,Best Humidifier!,"So pleased with this product!  It's so easy to clean and fill!  Why didn't they start building humidifiers like this sooner?!  I don't use it in my bedroom but if I decide I need one Ill buy the same one.  The ability to turn off all the lights including the digital display is the greatest idea ever, as someone who suffers from life long insomnia that alone had made me a levoit fan for life.  Every levoit product I have bought so far is absolute quality."
280,Not just one of the bestÿ,"I have had several humidifiers over the years and they were all lacking in one way or another:  too noisy, too hard or impossible to clean, too little or too much humidity. But the Levoit, which I worried was under-priced and therefore of poor quality, makes owning a humidifier a pleasure. And the bonus? A reliable sync app that makes this humidier the best on the market for most of us."
281,This humidifier requires an app for full functionality,"if you want to change the humidity level you MUST use the app, no way to do that on the device itself. You need a smart phone and a wifi connection and you need to connect this device to your bluetooth and wifi connection.  I¡¯m updating this after using the humidifier for a week.  I¡¯m using the app and it doesn¡¯t work that well - continually disconnecting from the device.  Super annoying.  Such a shame because outside of the app issues this thing really is AWESOME.  If u can live without adjusting the humidity or with the PITA app then BUY THIS THING."
282,Too annoying to use without App!,"If you are wanting to use this mister without their app, it is very frustrating. The manual buttons on the machine are touch buttons with no physical response to let you know if you have activated it or not. After you add water, it is very difficult to turn on the unit because nothing will show on the display unless you hold the power button and the wireless symbol lights up. Maybe if you wait long enough, the auto will turn it on, but they could at least show that on the display, instead it stays blank and makes you question the float switch. I'm sure that for marketing reasons they want you to use the app so they can track and spam you. Use an unmonitored email account. App works better, shows that it is on and working with the info you need. Should be easy to use without the App!"
283,DO NOT BUY., There is actual mold growing all inside the product. Disgusting. Can't believe I've been sleeping with it on every single day. I followed the cleaning instructions to a T and cleaned it out the moment the app said it is time to clean. And yet there's mold and algae growing on it. It has such fine crevices with mold that it's impossible to reach there and clean! So disappointed! Had trouble breathing so we looked closely and saw all this mold. Horrible.
284,Does not fully meet my needs,"While the option to control the Levoit humidifier with your smart phone is a nice option, the humidifier is missing the flexibility to change the  auto humidity settings manually.  It does not have the option of changing the factory preset humidity cutoff settings in the auto mode unless you use the smart phone app.  I need a higher auto cutoff setting and do not wish to have to create an account with privacy issues, passwords, etc.  Another issue is the screen display cannot be darkened when the humidifier is in the manual mode which is problematic for sleep if the auto mode is not at a desirable level.  I have also found the humidistat changes its readings much more quickly than the humidity in a room could change."
285,LOVE IT!,"Love this humidifier so much I bought 2!  Does leak water when I lift it to put more water in, but seems they all do."
286,More output than my Homemedics Humidifier,No noise and simple to use
287,Doesn't really get over 41% humidity.,I contacted support when my unit never got higher humidity than 41% as indicated by an external hygrometer. What did they say? Could you send us a video? What part of no higher humidity than 41% didn't they understand? It went back due to a lack of support. The unit was quiet and easy to refill.
288,this is a clean everyday item,"this product i left go for 2 days before i cleaned and it was creating red mold that fast. not good for your health,"
289,Works well,"If you have the option, filling an empty/unused tub with water works similarly well.

This product doesn't spew as much white smoke if you keep it on medium humidity output. At that rate it goes through about a gallon a day and sometimes is struggling to maintain 30% humidity. Cleaning is difficult unless you use vinegar to soften up the scale created by mineral rich water and at least for me needs to be done ~every 2-3 weeks. If you miss a piece of scale cleaning it can create a false positive causing the app to tell you to clean the humidifier again when you cleaned it that day. Simple fix, find the floating thing in the water and pull it out.

Issue: when you keep the humidifier on auto, adding cold water drops the temp and can force the unit to falsely claim the humidity has jumped 15-30 percent humidity thus shutting it off for up to 3 hours while the water temp warms up. Only way around this would be a cord with the humidity sensor on the end."
290,The best I¡¯ve ever had,The Best I¡¯ve ever had honestly. Easy to use and the water tank is so big it lasts all night. I honestly don¡¯t have not one bad thing to say about this product. Just buy it already
291,Wrong humilityÿ the auto doesn't work,"Looks great and elegant,  sadly the sensor doesn't read correctly so I need to manually use this instead of leaving it on auto. Everything else works"
292,Not good enough for big room,My bedroom is an about 300 sq. I set max(high) but couldn't reach 40% humidity all night. I used just a month(January).
293,A pain to clean,"This humidifier is really nice, however the reason I was purchasing a new one was to find one that was easier to clean! This humidifier has a hidden compartment below the tank where water sits and it is a huge pain to clean. Not only do you have to clean the actual tank (which is pretty easy to clean) but the area below has several little crevices and levers and it's just awful. Do yourself a favor and find a different humidifier. I just don't understand how this was designed so poorly, I think manufacturers assume that no one cares about mold...."
294,This is the humidifier you want - get this one!,This is the third (or fourth) humidifier we've tried in the past decade and I finally feel like we've found the one that truly works and will last. The automated features are also really nice and work very well.
295,Great value humidifier,"It's a workhorse that you only have to water. Well, and clean once a week.

Our petsitter complained that our house was dry, and I agreed. Wirecutter recommended this humidifier, and I couldn't be more pleased.

It took four days of constant running to get the room up to 40% humidity (in the machine's ""auto"" range), so we filled it almost twice a day. But it's so quiet, you hardly hear it running."
296,good produce,"It is a good produce, very quiet."
297,This took the electric crackle out of our home!,Love this product! The built in humidistat lets us know when we need to kick up the mist. By downloading the app it makes managing the humidifier easy and sends you a reminder to fill and clean!
298,Great humidifier,Great device. We were looking a quiet effective humidifier for the bedroom. This device is an amazing product for the price. Get one!
299,Amazing Humidifier,"This humidifier must ave been designed by an industrial engineer. Refilling the water tank works so easily. Pick it up, fill it in the sink and replace it. That's it! everything fits perfectly."
300,Love the machine. Hate the App,Have 2 of these babies. Living Room & Master Bedroom.  Best ultrasonic units we¡¯v had. But the App is almost nothing but a selling tool with product functionality as an afterthought. I probably won¡¯t get them for the kids¡¯ rooms till they change the App.
301,Leaked,I liked at first. Then it leaked all over and warped my wood floor. I even had a pan under it. Would not recommend.
302,Just what the Doctor Ordered,"Needed a new humidifier for the downstairs. This looked like the perfect one, and it is. Easy instructions, easy filling, a lot of extras. Love it."
303,Love it!,Chicago has two seasons - humidifier and dehumidifier. I¡¯m glad I got this humidifier for our super dry winter. It¡¯s so quiet and efficient. I highly recommend it for anyone that ends up sparking everything they touch ÿ
304,Overall great,"Good product. Works well, adequate tank volume, easy to use. Sleep mode without the app the biggest problem. Does not work correctly, and the hygrometer is quite off. Through the app, can set target humidity and control sleep mode. Doing that, works excellent."
305,"Easy to use, quiet","My wife wanted something as quiet as possible for sleeping. Our old evaporation humidifier fan was quite loud, even on low. This one is almost silent and keeps the bedroom from drying out in the winter months. This was exactly what we were looking for. I've only cleaned it once so far, but it seemed pretty easy and straight forward."
306,Beautiful efficiency and simplicity in a quality humidifier!,"This has been a very dry winter here and I needed a humidifier to help be sleep better.  I bought a different brand for my wife a year ago and it works alright but is a little cumbersome and you cannot see the water level without removing its top part.
I bought the Levoit 300s and it is just about perfect for a humidifier.  It is very quiet, has a large see-through tank, it does a great job putting moisture into the air and is easy to clean.  I highly recommend this humicifier! I forgot so say it is so nice and compact it can be placed anywhere!"
307,Do not buy!,"I should have read the reviews closely before buying this. The two main reasons I purchased this humidifier is : 1. Top fill 2. Turn off display light.

The top fill mechanism although convenient has a major design flaw where the first time I was filling water I accidentally put water down the pipe through which the mist is supposed to come out. This is a major no no!!

As for turning off the display, I realized it automatically puts the humidifier in auto mode (which I did not want). I apparently cannot control this auto mode unless I install the app (which is crazy intrusive for running a damn humidifier).

I would return this stupid product if I could! Useless, do not buy. For $70, I am sure there are better ones on the market"
308,Humidifier leaves white residue on surfaces in house,"Humidifier did a decent job of adding moisture to the air.  I returned the unit because it left a fine white residue on all the surfaces in our house.  The owners manual indicated the you should use distilled water to prevent ""white dust"" around the humidifier.  We used distilled water and didn't feel it was worth it to have to dust our house every day."
309,Excellent humidifier,"Wi-Fi connectivity, built-in hygrometer, programmable and controllable via a solid app, either at or away from home. What else could you ask for for $60?"
310,I absolutely love this humidifier,"I initially purchased Levoit¡¯s LV600 humidifier for my plants. I needed a 2nd plant humidifier and decided to give this one a go and I fell in love. It is so quiet, so easy to fill and the app is very user friendly. I loved it so much that I bought a 3rd for my nightstand! I highly recommend."
311,Product got bad within a month.,Product not functioning as intended. I packed Product for return but forgot to do so until return window closed. I will not recommend this product to anybody.
312,works as advertised !!,stopped our nose bleeds from dry air
313,Fantastic Humidifier,"Silent, easy to fill, powerful humidifier"
314,Product broke after cleaning,"This humidifier is too difficult to clean; after the second cleaning, the humidifier was restarted is now constantly glitching. I would not recommend this product!"
315,Can't live without,Its a must have in the bedroom
316,THIS IS THE ONE!!  JUST GET IT NOW~,"I've tried several humidifiers to deal with dry winter climate and sinuses at night. Hand down, the product is the best: silent, programmable (with an app!), elegant design, and it WORKS !!!  I bought two and will be getting another pair. When you do, you will be shocked by the hoe much better you feel.. and BREATHE!"
317,Awesome,Works exactly as advertised..Definitely recommend
318,It does what IT wants to do,"Super quiet, super cute, and superbly annoying! I turn it off, manually or by app, and I come back and it¡¯s on again. Put it in sleep mode, and it turns the display back on. I decided I would keep it because it¡¯s so quiet, and  I could just unplug- then it turned itself off. Hmmmm decisions"
319,Quiet & Efficient,"I didn't know that distilled water was recommended; and while that is a bit of a hassle, the device itself is the best humidifier I've ever had. I particularly like the humidistat reading."
320,Almost Silent,"Love the quiet operation,  easy-to-fill-in-place reservoir, smart-phone controllable commands.
I intensely dislike the bright-white display, which apparently cannot be turned off or dimmed while unit is in operation."
321,constantly leaked - terrible product,"I had to throw this away, terrible product. Purchased after reading the Wirecutter review, but within the first week it started to leak water overnight between the top reservoir and the base. This would happen at least once a week over the month I used it. These were not small leaks, by the morning I had a pool of water on my floor and damaged my dresser.

In addition to the leaking, the ""auto"" feature would cause the unit to stop working - it would cut off the mist at the appropriate levels, but then the unit would  not resume once the humidity dropped. The only way to get the unit to work again was to unplug and plug back in."
322,Don't purchase the Mineral Absortion Pad!,"I purchased the Levoit 300s, the basic humidifier, and it appears to be working fine. However, before completing my original purchase, I added the LV600HH Mineral Absorption Pad, seemed like the right thing to do.  BAD choice, as this pad does not match the 300s and is useless!.  Instead, it is for the Levoit Humidifier LV600HH model, so now I wasted my money because they couldn't list the correct filter pad, if one exists.  Since this is how sloppy they advertise their product, I will not buy any Levoit product and advise anyone considering a Levoit product about my experience."
323,Wisper quite,I like the whole thing except for the scent try being in the back rather then be on a side that would be easier to reach.
324,"Great product, poor customer service.","Easy to assemble, instructions are clear, works great EXCEPT... We received our first and IMMEDIATELY got messages for water tank needing refilled or cleaned and it would stop running. Reached out to Customer Support, they don't answer, and don't have a voicemail. So after emailing nothing. Tried everything again a week and two weeks later. Nothing. Finally gambled on returning product for an exchange, no problem with the product works great.  Just got the Lemon on the first purchase. FYI - 7 weeks later- Finally, received a generic email from Customer service regarding the standard troubleshooting guide that was in the manual for filling the water tank error."
325,Indicator reads 40% too high.,Unit said the room was at 70% when it was at 30%. Sent it back. There is NO PHONE SUPPORT
326,"Engineering problem with the rubber gasket, humidifier leaks, probably around the gasket.","Humidifier leaks, damaged my hardwood floor.  I have another unit and it works fine."
327,Great smart features,"Great humidifier. Love the app - notifies you to clean it, depending on your frequency you choose, tells you when issues arise, etc. pumps out a lot of humidity and love that I can connect it to my phone!"
328,Perfect for adding the humidity that we were lacking!,"Works perfectly! Quiet, auto controls the humidity level. Nice to be able to turn off all lights at night. I have definitely noticed the white dust that ultrasonic humidifiers can produce so I now use distilled water and no longer have the problem. Overall very happy with this humidifier!"
329,I bought 2 and they work well.,I bought two of these to cover my living room and master bedroom. It¡¯s easy to use and clean. Even filling is not difficult. I will note that we have a lot of dark furniture and dark wood floors. It leaves a fine white dust. In a matter of days. I bought these because my whole house steam humidifier on my furnace broke. I can¡¯t wait to get a replacement. I don¡¯t know what that fine white dust is but I don¡¯t like it.
330,"Outputs plenty of humidity, Quiet","Very quiet and unobtrusive unit given its size. Our house is very dry during winter, and evaporative humidifiers have just been unable to keep up with the demand (They do not seem to wick fast enough as usually 90% of the wicking material is completely dry). This unit was on sale and well reviewed by third-party review sources, so we decided to give it a try. This unit will go through about 2 tanks a day on high, which keeps our humidity around 40-45%. Without this unit running, we are usually around 20%. Sleeping is easier, there seems to be less dust accumulation around the house, and our skin feels much less dry after spending the day in the house. I've only had this unit for a few months, so the jury is still out on longevity, but so far this unit has been great and I would purchase again without hesitation."
331,Phone Control Only,"This is not a bad humidifier. I'd give it five stars if you could set humidity level on the unit itself. Not possible. In order to set the humidity level (from the factory default) you need to download the veSync app and control the unit from your phone. A bit annoying. So, if you have a flip phone, beware! Definitely quieter than other humidifiers I have owned."
332,Super quiet and quick,This unit is very quiet and brought the humidity up from a dry 32% to 45% in about 36 hours. We run a wood stove to heat about 1000 square feet so the air is constantly dry. It has been keeping the humidity level about 44-45%. I like that it holds a large amount of water that lasted about 24 hours when we were trying to bring the humidity up at first. It has been lasting about 2+ days now that the humidity is right where we want it. The wifi feature is nice and the app works well. I haven't used the night light or sleep mode but they are there if I want them. A little more than I wanted to spend but I am happy with the purchase.
333,Quiet- works great! Worth the money!!,"The Voit unit is quiet, one of the units on the market that I have in the bedroom, easy to clean and wipe down, and the app worked well for me."
334,I love this!,Bought this for my living room. I live in California and the air is so dry here. I'm from Cincinnati so I'm used to the humidity. This is where this came in. It has with my dry skin.
335,Great humidifier,Amazing humidifier!
336,Nice unit. Works well.,"Quiet, easy to use, works well"
337,Super Quiet,Loving how quiet this is as well as how I can still use with my essential oils.  Very easy set up and easier to clean because the whole top lid comes off.
338,Soft Air,Very easy to use; a welcome relief from dry sleeping air
339,The Little Engine That Could!,"We live in the upper Midwest in the U.S. and needed to boost the humidity in our family room during the cold winter months when the furnace is running more.  Our Levoit humidifier has been in constant use since we removed it from the box and is proving to be the ""Little Engine That Could"" in maintaining our humidity in the optimal 40 - 50% range.  We keep ours filled with distilled water and consumption will vary according to the ambient humidity or lack thereof.  Controls are simple and intuitive and we especially like the large digital humidity display.  I'm noticing fewer dry skin issues as well as no problems with dry eyes since acquiring the Levoit.  Very pleased with this purchase."
340,"I sort of hate this humidifier, but it works","The humidifier does what it says and has a nice set of built-in features, but there are two issues that annoy me:

1) Almost every time after refilling, the humidifier shuts off by itself.  Then I turn it on and it shuts off again, only this time the ""no water"" light comes on despite the tank being full.  The only way to get it to reset is to lift the tank off and put it back on, and sometimes I have to do it 2-3 times before it registers & works correctly.

2) Speaking of the tank, the entire top just lifts off of this one.  Convenient for cleaning, not convenient for not making a mess.  We use this in an upstairs bedroom, so to fill we either have to carry the tank to the main floor (we use filtered water), or take a pitcher of water up to the tank.  Either way, I end up having to remove the tank (see #1 above) and it drips water everywhere, or if you tilt it just a little too much when it's full, water will spill over the sides.  My previous humidifier fill through a screw cap on the bottom, which made carrying without spilling a breeze."
341,Super Quiet,Compared to other humidifiers I have owned and the pump noises and or water gulping sounds this one is almost no noise at all.  Aroma pad works too.
342,Great humidifier,"I love this so much I bought one more! It¡¯s easy to fill, easy to clean, easy to operate. It works really well and I totally love this product"
343,First one didnt work so they replaced and now this one is great...really pumps the moisture,First one didnt work so they replaced and now this one is great...really pumps the moisture---dont know what sleep mode does as I dont have cell service so just turn it on...I like it now
344,Solid Product,"Love having moisture in the air for my home. This works greats, Has such a long run time and I mean its 6L. super amazing. Great product. Its quiet and easy to use 10/10"
345,this thing is great,"so far I've had it for 11 months. if you only use distilled water, you don't have to worry about cleaning it (from my experience) it runs basically all day with the exception of a few hours. the timer mode is great. it's quiet. you can shut off the display of you're like me and like to sleep in the dark.

I go through about 2 gallons every 36 hours of use, with the humidity set to 50%. the winter sees a lot more use as we get dry air. unlike other reviews I read, I have had no leak issues whatsoever. love that it's cool mist, and helps me sleep better at night with the humidity levels between 30-50%. highly recommend if you're looking!

one last thing. you can control it with an app on your phone (I have Android, iPhone may be different) and can control it with Alexa. perfect. smartphone app also let's you know when the tank runs empty and auto shuts off!"
346,Didn't work properly,"I recieved mine in the mail a week ago and have been trying to get it to work ever since. I read all the manuals and even contacted customer support. The tank is full to the max line with water but every time I try to turn it on, it cuts off and says that the tank is empty and needs to be filled. I did however recieve great customer service and another one was shipped to me, but haven't recieved it yet."
347,"Works great, but wasn't expecting to have to use distilled water","Moved from Florida to Michigan and the dry winter heated air was not working for my skin. Bought this to help and it definitely does. However, I didn't read the reviews/directions that said they recommend distilled water. If you don't use distilled water, all your surfaces get covered in a fine white dust. It's a little freaky. I'm trying a little experiment to see if I can set out tap water for a few days and reduce the white dusty stuff. Stay tuned"
348,I like,"Works well, I only run it on low, so I don't even hear it run. I just set it, and fill it. I think it is fantastic. I think it's a pain you have to use an app to adjust settings. I'm an old man, not really up on the smart appliance era stuff. But I did figure out how to download app and adjust setting to my desired levels.
  I did have an issue around the 3rd  mo. of use. The tank developed a small crack ( I guess from some kind stress), which grew everyday. I thought I'd try the contact seller option, and see if I could get any solution to this problem. Levoit has a phone number to call, but a recording tells you there is no one to answer the phone (why is there a phone number?). But to go online and leave a message, they will get back to you in a day or two. That is what I did ( wishing I could actually talk to a real live person). But CJ messaged me back within days. There were a few massages back and forth, and he requested my Amazon receipt and pics of my cracked tank. As I stated earlier I am not so digitally savvy, but finally got through that process.  CJ got back to me and thanked me for the information he requested. He said he would check options for my problem. By this time the crack had reached the bottom of the tank, but still not leaking yet so I was still using it. In Nebraska you need to put moisture in your home in winter, or everything dries out including me. Anyway I am very happy to say CJ said he would send a new unit to me, and not to send my cracked unit to them. Around a week later I have a new humidifer. Even though I never got to verbalize with a human, I am very pleased and satisfied with CJs resolve in this case, and thank him for his professionalism. I would hesitate to purchase products from them in the future."
349,Super quiet. Works well for bedroom,Extremely quiet operation. Works well for medium size bedroom.
350,Works well but the app is terrible,"I got this for our newborn to help with the dry winter air. It works well and is easy to clean, however the app is awful. You can¡¯t control most of the settings without the app, but it constantly unpairs with bluetooth. It also is constantly reverting to auto mode and turns off once it decides your room is humid enough - which is typically after 15-20 min. I keep switching it to manual mode so it will stay on and it always turns itself back to auto the next time it¡¯s used."
351,Dust Producing Machine / Waste of Money,"If anyone is considering a humidifier during the winter,  I recommend that you do NOT purchase an ultrasonic one, especially this one.  First of all, the control buttons are a joke that don¡¯t depress when you touch them so any on/off or adjustment you are attempting to do is very frustrating. I did not want to use the app. because, really, I don¡¯t want to need my cell phone just to run a humidifier! You have to use ONLY distilled water in it all the time or you will get white dust over everything in your whole house, not just the room where this thing is located.  I bought this (now trashed for multiple reasons) because it held more water and could conveniently be refilled from the top. After frustratingly using it for over a month, I started having a hacking dry pee -in-your-pants type of cough and when I noticed a heavy coating of dust on everything in my house (even after I recently dusted) I started doing some research and put two and two together. The one I purchased only suggested distilled water which i admittedly did not use since I believed the minerals in my well water were already neutralized by the filter system in my basement. The ultrasonic action causes any existing minerals to produce white dust. Interestingly, Ultrasonic humidifiers disperse water by a vibration that can only be heard by animals as an unpleasant sound. Is this why my cat  avoided coming into my bedroom since I bought this thing?!  So I¡¯m back to using my old regular humidifier because I don¡¯t want to be a slave to purchasing distilled water in order to avoid white dust. I am now dust and hacking cough free. New-fangled is not always better. Save your money and just buy a regular humidifier without all the useless bells and whistles. This is the worst thing I ever purchased on Amazon. I really question the validity of any positive reviews."
352,So helpful in these cold winter months!,"I love the ""auto"" feature of this humidifier because I can set it and forget it. It keeps the room's humidity to 40-50% so I don't wake up with a scratchy throat or a nosebleed due to the dry air from the heater. It has a large water capacity, so I'm finding that I don't have to refill it as often. The top comes off easily, so it's easy to refill. I just bring a big jug of water and pour it in. It even has a small pocket in the back to add essential oils.

It is so quiet that I don't even hear it. There is a night light feature too. I haven't connected it to the app because I don't really need to, but I like that there is that option. It's also really easy to clean and it comes with a cleaning brush. We use reverse osmosis filtered water, so I don't need to clean it that often.

I got a different humidifier for another room, but I wish I got two of these instead. I definitely recommend this."
353,Great Humidifier Butÿ.,"This works well to get the humidity up in my house, but it leaves a white film all over everything the fine mist particles land on."
354,Humidifier thinks its empty,"This would be a great humidifier if it didn't have a bug to were I guess the sensor is off? I'm not sure exactly what is wrong with it but even when the tank is full of water I get a notification that the tank is empty and it shuts off and won't come on. I've tried the trouble shooting on the app and reaching out to the company on the app twice with no response. If it weren't for this it would be perfect. Its quiet, it has a large top fill tank, a night light, set the humidity level, and set it on a schedule. But all those perks are useless if it doesn't stay on."
355,Very Quiet and Easy to Use,"We have been very happy with this humidifier. Super easy to set up and easy to use. Ultra Quiet performance, and easy to set up Blu-Tooth app make this a desirable product. Just be sure and use a very light touch on the buttons. Pushing them hard doesn't do anything. We would highly recommend this product."
356,Outstanding Humidifier,I love this humidifier.  Have it paired with Alexa and use Alexa to turn on/off humidifier.  Use it mainly during cold days when central heat is running more than usual.  Provides a more comfortable ambient and it keeps the wood furniture from drying out.  A setting of low or medium is more than enough to keep the house comfortable.
357,It works great,"Love that I can check it on my phone! Works better than the other 12 humidifiers I have bought over the years. Solidly built, expect it to last for years. Perfect to help seniors, all they have to do is fill it. You can do the rest!"
358,You really need the app to control it.,This works great as long as you have the app. The buttons on the unit do not work that well and have no tactile feedback. I pushed the power button several times in order for it to actually turn on. Same with the other buttons. Controlling it with the app was much easier. I keep it on auto most of the time but I don't know how accurate the humidity sensor is. My weather station does not agree with the humidity level on the unit. This has a huge tank and will run continuously for 18 hours or more on one tank full. I love the top fill feature. I am overall satisfied with this unit. But I wish their panel controls were of higher quality.
359,Great humidifier,"Works great, not annoyingly loud, top filled so it's easy to fill. Though it is a bit picky with wifi if you want to connect it to your phone."
360,Should have listened to the reviews,"This product was AMAZING for maybe 3-4 months. Now it only works for maybe an hour before it starts leaking water everywhere.

Spend more money on a better humidifier."
361,DO NOT BUY.  Company does not respond to support requests.,"After one week, the filter is brown.  I emailed support to purchase a filter replacement for Levoit 300S humidifier.  The automated response was useless.  DO NOT BUY Levoit products because they do not support their products."
362,Impressed with the IoT technologies,"I like the physical design, it¡¯s very modular and inconspicuous. But what is so far impressive is the app and how it is integrated connecting the device to the Internet allowing a whole range of functionalities an operation that doesn¡¯t even require me to touch the device again."
363,Great humidifier,"Great humidifier, quite, easy to use and the night mode is nice. It turns off the lights and screen. Has auto setting to manage a certain humidity level. The app notifies me when to clean it."
364,Issue with Auto mode changing to manual on its own in the app,This was a major problem when I didn't catch it and it ran full power for 2 hours on my plants.
365,Would love this if the tank were twice the size,"The humidifier does its job, and the internal humidistat seems to function as intended to cycle mist on and off to maintain our desired 50% humidity level. I like that I can set automatic on/off schedules with the app (although wouldn't have paid extra for it if there had been a similar model that wasn't WiFi enabled), but would have liked to see a vacation mode in the app so that when away, I don't have to disable my two schedules, which requires a few clicks through the app to find.  These are minor issues since the unit does its job pretty well otherwise.

My only complaint is that the unit needs to be refilled every two to three days. Our bedroom is about 12' x 17' ... so not especially large for a suburban master bedroom. Thankfully, its relatively easy to fill. I would have given it 4 stars but for the tank size."
366,Junk too high tech for its own good,"Ive had two of these units now and they both worked for a few weeks and then failed. It will spray mist for 30 seconds and then the red water light flashes and the unit turns off. The replacement just failed on me in the same way and im just done with it.

When it works its a nice unit a makes a good bit of mist, goes through a tank in about 1 day."
367,Amazing Unit,The reviews are accurate. Extra large water tank and east to fill. I can operate the unit with the app on my phone. Runs for the entire night plus some and definitely improved the air quality and humidity level. I will be buying a second. I¡¯m so glad I bought this one!
368,OK,It did what was advertized
369,Super quiet works really well.,"Nice 6 liter capacity, easy to clean. Absolutely silent and simple."
370,Loving it,"Got it because it was recommended by Wire cutter and it is great. THe noise is so low you can barely hear it and our humidity level increased wonderfully and is staying right. We used to experience very dry skin, constantly, dry nose and lots (LOTS) of static electricity. Now it's great! Plus, the essential oil smell is great, very soft (maybe a little too soft, but this is a humidifier, not a difuser)."
371,This is a must have for dry indoor air!,"LEVOIT Humidifiers for Bedroom Large Room Home, Smart Wifi Alexa Control, 6L Top Fill Cool Mi-It came quickly, It is simple to operate and is so quiet. I am loving it! My sinuses love it too!"
372,Excellent,Excellent humidifier. Works great. Does the job. Easy to clean and operate. Best we've ever had.
373,"Great, but not for us","I have mixed feelings. I am returning the item, but if it had worked for our purposes, I would keep it.

PRO: It's attractive, well-made, and super silent. The controls are perfect - cycle through auto, low, medium, high, with each clearly marked. Dim the display with the touch of a button (VERY nice). I don't expect the read-out to be accurate, because it's built in to a machine that is putting out mist, so of course it reads higher than a hygrometer placed elsewhere in the room. I used filtered water (from the fridge door dispenser), and noticed no white residue. Cleaning the tank is easy, but do not buy a cool-mist humidifier if you're not committed to frequent cleaning (daily rinse, weekly vinegar soak.)

CON (for us): Even though our living room is within the intended dimensions, it is open by doorways to the rest of the house. Therefore, the humidifier could only raise the room's humidity by about 3-5% on very cold, dry days when the HVAC was running a lot. That's not enough.
Then we decided to try it in our bedroom. It raised the humidity to a nice, comfortable level (37% on our separate hygrometer, 10+ feet away from the unit), definitely not too humid. Both my husband and I noticed that our lungs felt weird all day the next day. Sort of ""itchy."" This was with a 4-day-old machine that had been rinsed daily, and filled using only filtered water. I don't know why this would be. There was no evidence of anything nasty in the tank or in the base where the water goes to be turned into mist. Everything looked very clean. Cleaning is easy. If I had kept it, I would plan to do a vinegar soak weekly."
374,A great buy.,It really help us sleep well.
375,Best yet.,Quick and easy to fill and clean. Good output.  No filter to deal with! I've tried many top brands through the years and this seems best overall.
376,Great price for an effective and compact humidifier,"Bought this for my child's room as the humidity levels in winter are bone dry. It did a really fast job of bringing and keeping those levels up. It was important that this be unobtrusive at night and being able to turn off the lights on it completely is great. Its very quiet, you don't realize when its on. Connecting it to the app was super easy and you're able to set things like the target humidity level easily. I will replace my larger wick style humidifier with this model whenever it breaks down. You don't have to worry about mold as much. If you have hard water it helps to buy a conditioner you add to the water to reduce mineral build up."
377,High Quality,This is the third Levoit product I have purchased and all are working just as good as the day I plugged then in. Just a nice well built product.
378,The leaking humidifier,This humidifier leaked the very first day my daughter used it at her home as it was a gift for my granddaughter. It leaked all over everything and even all over the kitchen counter and floor. Not good. I do not recommend this product. Refund please.
379,Worked 4 months,Worked 4 months well then only turns on when plugged in.  It shuts off immediately.  Not a value for the money at only 4 months of service.  Find a different humidifier
380,It was amazing until it started leaking,Used mostly at night in master bedroom. I really enjoyed this humidifier because the settings can be remotely programmed and  personalized. The water output setting is amazing. However for the past few days it has started leaking for no apparent reason. I clean (weekly) and change (daily) the water in the humidifier as instructed. I don¡¯t carry the base and the water tank together so as no to ¡®shake¡¯ it and it continues to leak. I¡¯ve checked everything as per the manual and I still don¡¯t know what¡¯s wrong. Haven¡¯t had the unit very long - perhaps a month. Very disappointed. Tried calling customer services as instructed in the manual. recording indicates to send an email.
381,Humidity is back.,"Bought this humidifier about a month ago. So far it is working well. We run it non stop. I¡¯ve cleaned it twice. Easy to clean taking it apart and reassembling - like 3 parts. We¡¯ve been using filtered water, distilled is recommended. The filter has turned tan from white, some white powder visible on some surfaces. Overall, it seems like a good product."
382,What a fix for dry eyes!!!,"It's just great.  Makes no noise and is super easy to clean and the 3 levels of humidify are easy to change with the swipe of a finger.
I have severely dry eyes and need cataract surgery, but my opthamologist explained he was unable to do surgery until I correct the dry eyes.  I am doing multiple things to help my eyes and one of them being the humidifier.  I am most grateful.  Highly recommend"
383,Massively leaky,I really liked this humidifier for its large capacity and ability to raise ambient humidity in my small apartment. However it leaks horribly! On 4 separate occasions I came home to find the floor flooded and most recently this was right after cleaning out the tank so there was no buildup to blame. It is just faulty so I am returning. Hopefully the next model will be better!
384,Wish I had purchased 2,Very quiet
385,It seems that the room is warmer.,"This product has made it easier to breathe in the excessively dry weather. It also seems that the room is warmer. Very quiet. Great experience, so far."
386,Nice humidifier but diffuser doesn¡¯t work,"The humidifier is quiet and well-functioning, however the aromatherapy diffuser is useless."
387,Worked fine at first ...,"I liked the small footprint and the positive reviews, and I have a Levoit air purifier like, so I ordered this unit.  It worked fine for the first few weeks.  Now, it does not power up unless I first unplug and plug it back in.  Not sure if I'll return it or just trash it.  Probably not going with Levoit again for anything."
388,Leaks,LeaksI bought this for my son¡¯s new apartment and it leaks.
389,Got used item and it leaked all over,"Opened the item and it smelled faintly of Vicks Vapor Rub and saw small water droplets in the tank. So this was a previous return that had been repackaged.
Poured water in the tank and learned why - it leaked all over.
Returning it and will not purchase again"
390,Very little after 2 months,"Inspite of regular cleaning, mist amount suddenly went down to very little after 2 months. This is even when it's set to max."
391,Misty air,Great device.  Follow the Instructions and you won¡¯t have a problem. Great machine just take care of it and use the distilled or purified water
392,"Bought this for the ""Auto"" feature, but it's USELESS!","So I upgraded to this more expensive unit, with it's fancy WiFi/App, and auto features.  UNFORTUNATELY, their Humidity sensor must be ""inside the water tank"" or something, because it shows the Humidity in our room, WAAAAY Higher that what 2 other sensors show it to be!  Makes it real hard to get the Auto function to work, to say... keep the Humidity at 50%, when it won't even turn itself on, cause it thinks it at 63, when it's really only around 42/43 percent!  SMH!  What a design flaw!!"
393,Perfect,"This is exactly what I was looking for in a new humidifier.  I love that I can set the humidity level and control on and off times.  The App works wonderfully.  Easy set up.
Non paid review. :)"
394,Wi-Fi connection,Keeps losing internet connection
395,Great small humidifier,"This is a great humidifier for the price. It¡¯s small and very quiet, and had the bells and whistles of more expensive units. However, the base seems to get dirty quickly. While it¡¯s pretty easy to clean, there are some spaces that are tough to get at. All in all, it¡¯s worth the purchase."
396,So hard to clean,"I will used this for the rest of the winter and then probably get rid of yet.  The humidistat is great, its basically noise free and the app works great. The problem is it is so so so hard to clean.  There are tiny little places that I can't get to and I can see black/green gunk in them.  What am I breathing in at night??  If this item was easier to clean, I'd give it 5 stars and tell everyone to get it. Due to how hard it is to clean, I would not recommend this humidifier."
397,Perfect find,I looked at so many & some much less money but this was a great find I don¡¯t hess see r it & it¡¯s so easy to clean
398,"LEVOIT Humidifiers for Bedroom Large Room Home, Smart Wifi Alexa Control, 6L Top Fill Cool Mi",An excellent replacement of a humidifier. Queit and very easy to use and understand. On time delivery.
399,Works great as described,"Super quiet, shows humidity level constantly does the job highly recommended"
400,Omg love this thing,
401,White dust everywhere,They recommend distilled water to prevent this and tried that same resultsÿ white powdery dust builds up on everything.
402,Reliable,I love this humidifier. Its super quiet and easy to use. Lasts all night and qorks really well.
403,Couldn¡¯t even use it,The tank didn¡¯t seal to the base and immediately began leaking everywhere
404,White dust in the whole house. Even in the closed areas/rooms.,"Works well, but creates white dust in a day."
405,inadequate manual,"the machine seems to work OK, although it does not increase the humidity in our apartment a lot, but probably is working at it's capacity.
My real complaint is that the power button CANNOT be operated by pressing on it.  You need to gently wipe your finger across it.  Is that in the manual? No?"
406,Just need to keep clean,"After too much time comparing one humidifier against another, I bought 2 of these. Read the directions, and it's recommended to rinse and change water daily. I use filtered water, and things could be ugly if I don't stay on top of it. It's not bad to clean. Extremely happy"
407,This humidifier is a great bang for the buck!,"My old humidifier bit the dust a month ago so I was in the market for a new one.  I knew what i needed since the prior humidifier was lacking in both.  My main criteria was a large tank reservoir that would hold about a day's quantity of water.  The other was a water reservoir that was easy to fill and with handles to transport the heavy water to the base.  Many humidifiers, including my old one, want to look like a fashion statement.  That means a rounded appearance which decreases the volume of water you can fill it with.  I was also tired of having to flip the tank over, unscrew the cap, fill it, put cap on, right the tank and put on base.  This humidifier has two handles on each side of the reservoir that you can easily use to transport water.  To fill it, I simple put on the floor of tub, turn on spigot, fill it and that is it.  Another bonus is that the top part ie water reservoir, mates perfectly with the base.  No maddening adjustments if it is not put on properly.  Like many humidifiers, the digital humidity level reading  is not 100% accurate.  We have a manual humidity level detector.  The Levoit was off a few degrees but no big deal.  The night light has 2 brightness settings although we do not use it.  The digital display is bright and might bother some people trying to sleep.  You could always put something in front of it to block the light if it bothers you.  I have not yet tried the wifi capabilities via the app.  Excellent instructions tell you exactly which parts of the device need periodic cleaning.  All in all, a well constructed humidifier that fits our needs."
408,Great humidifier,Nearly silent. Easy to refill and clean.
409,Exactly perfect for my bedroom humidity!,"Exactly perfect for my bedroom humidity!  Ease of use, adding water, cleaning & digital monitoring with app is very satisfactory."
410,Works great,Holds plenty of water for couple days. Quiet. WiFi app control. Lots of features and most importantly makes air comfortable with moisture and machine looks nice.
411,Great smart humidifier,"I've had this for a few months now, and it is still working great. I've never once had issues with it leaking, and only one time had issues connecting to the app, which may have been a local network problem.

It has a great variety of mist strength options, and the water lasts a pretty long time. I love being able to control with an app.

I'm pretty happy with my purchase."
412,Just what we wanted.,"We bought one for our second-floor bedroom.  We were so impressed we bought one for our first-floor sun-room.

5 stars for noise and sleep mode.
No rating for 'Easy to Clean' because we haven't had to clean it.  I suspect that will be 5 starts as well."
413,"Humidifier itself is good, butÿ",a bunch of tiny cracks formed at the bottom corners of the tank.  All four corners.  Water would slowly seep through to the outside.  I ended up supergluing all the tiny cracks and the water does not deep through anymore.  The glue has also prevented the cracks from growing.  Other than that the unit does what I need it to do: provide much needed humidity inside the house.
414,Loved until I didn¡¯t,"The humidity gage stopped working. Lately, the humidifier started leaking for no reason. Not very happy with it after having it for a bit."
415,Works like a charm,"Easy to set up and connect to Alexa. Can turn it off at night without getting out of bed, or turn it on before I get home. Was concerned at first that it did not have warm mist, but finding the cool mist to actually be more comfortable. Does a good job at keeping the humidity where I need itÿ and accurate according to other humidity sensors in the room."
416,Best Humidifier Ever,Quite and easy to use. Love the auto shutoff.
417,Highly recommend,I've not tried to clean it yet but it looks like it's easier than a different brand I previously purchased.
418,Best Humidifier For medium size room.,Improved the humidity % in my room by 10%. Easy to clean and great smart features.
419,"Quiet, efficient and refreshing", It's very quiet and produces a great foggy mist. I haven't needed to add the app to operate for my needs. A friend of mine has been looking for a new humidifier and loves it so will be getting one as well!
420,Doesn't work bought more costly one works better,Does not work but more costly one does
421,Work Great,"The humidifier works great. However, the essential oil area doesn't open on one and the other two doesn't really put anything out that you can tell it is there."
422,Worked great until the flood,"This humidifier was effective and quiet.  Cleaning it was a bit of a hassle, but no more than any other humidifier.  After using it for about two weeks I cleaned it, refilled the tank and returned it to the bedroom table around midday.  That evening I discovered the entire tank of water had leaked out, overflowing a pan it sat in and drenching the rug.  I cleaned it all up and left it to dry overnight, but when I tried to set it up again it no longer worked.  I never figured out why the leak occurred, but would not trust it if it even started working again, so it has been returned and I will look for another company."
423,Did not work!,"I could not turn the unit on or off with the power switch. I was unable to contact customer support in a timely manner (only by email), so the item was returned."
424,Great product  Great price,"This has been a great humidifier so far. Made such a difference in my room. I sleep better, have less sinus issues and less static. Have bought another one to."
425,Not worth the extra cost compared to a basic humidifier.,"I purchased two of these humidifiers about a month ago, one dedicated to bedroom use and one that I have on a rolling cart so I can move it to various other rooms. As humidifiers these are fine, but the extra features (especially the ability to control them wirelessly) do not work consistently. I have encountered the following problems, all of which have been mentioned in the other user reviews:
1. The units will randomly turn themselves off.
2. The units will give an ¡°out of water¡± message, despite the tanks having plenty of water.
3. The units will regularly drop off my wireless network. Sometimes simply unplugging the unit and plugging it back in will restore network connectivity. In other cases, the unit has to be re-added as a new item, requiring the user to go through the entire procedure in the VeSync app.

These problems only developed after a few weeks of use, so I¡¯m not sure what to make of them (are they due to faulty software or some kind of hardware failure?). Regardless, the only way I could justify the high price of these humidifiers was because of the smart functionality, and with that not working properly they are definitely not worth the cost. I recommend you save some money and buy a basic humidifier, usually available at half the price of these models."
426,great product,large enough for overnight and quiet. my kitties like putting their noses up to the mist. so cute!
427,So far best humidifier I have ever owned,"Had this for a few days now.  NO LEAKS.  I haven't done the descaling yet, but that looks simple with vinegar.  Just empty and rinse daily and let air dry.  I use reverse osmosis purified water in mine.  It really puts out quite a bit of a fine ultrasonic mist.  Sound, I hear nothing when it is on.  Virtually silent.  I like the smart home features and use them  all the time.  The Vesync app worked on my Android phone flawlessly.  Easy to set up to work with my Amazon alexa.  Just tell Alexa to turn it on and off.  I love the auto function that will turn it on or off depending on the humidity level you have set and the built in humidity sensor.  Simple to put into sleep mode which will turn off all display lights.  It has a night light and an essential oil pad that I have not used and don't know that I will.  I really like that it has a water filter built in and a place to catch dust.  It also holds slot of water in the tank.
So far great and very happy with my purchase."
428,It works,It¡¯s a very good product.
429,Does not perform as advertised,Does not work as advertised
430,It is simple and easy to set up and use.,I like it so much I sent the next size smaller to my sister in Seattle for her apartment
431,Great humidifier,Humidifier works great.
432,"Almost Great, But Not Reliable","I bought five of these to use throughout my place a few months ago and replace some older ones that were on their last legs. Right away, I found them to be a MAJOR improvement, and I loved the ease of filling them, the automatic settings, and the app. I thought I had hit the jackpot!

A few months later:
1 of them has an issue in which the tank doesn't stop pouring into the basin after it's full, so the entire tank empties out onto the floor and down into my downstairs neighbor's unit (twice)--can't use that one anymore.
2 of them have regular issues where the base unit thinks it is out of water (and turns off) when the tank is actually full. So far this issue has gone away on its own after a while so the units are still usable, but not good.
2 of them have had difficulty connecting to wifi and have dropped off the network randomly.

It's a bummer, because the design and features are so great--would have been happy to pay a bit more for  some quality control. Not sure if I'll be able to keep them or just need to replace with something more reliable."
433,Smart Humidifier!,I really like the integrations this humidifier has with Google Assistant. I'm able to easily turn it on/off and set routines as well. Adding water and cleaning the machine is easy as well as adding essential oils like eucalyptus whenever I need to clear my sinuses. Aesthetic wise I think it looks nice as well and the night light is cute
434,As advertised and good value for money,Works well for small areas
435,Excellent for bedroom,"I needed a humidifier for my bedroom because I kept waking up with nose bleeds.  I wanted one that would be easy to clean and be quiet so as to not disturb my husband.  This is exceptionally quite, I even have to double check that it's turned on!  I love that I'm able to set a schedule thru the app so it turns on right before I head to bed and turns off as I'm waking up.  I do buy distilled water for it so cleaning has been a breeze--this may be different for others who use tap water.  Definately recommend!"
436,Total junk,"Yikes. This is the worst item I¡¯ve ever bought on Amazon. I ¡°upgraded¡± to this ¡°smart¡± humidifier, and it doesn¡¯t work on the auto, manual, or sleep settings. Okay wellÿ. it will work, but maybe for just 5 or 10 minutes at a time. Then it suddenly decides it¡¯s out of water (when it never has been even close to out of water) or just decides to shut off when the current humidity is 25% and it¡¯s supposed to be 45%, for no reason. I have bad sinuses in the winter and I have to wake up with a scratchy, burning throat every morning since I ¡°upgraded¡±, because this thing just will not stay on no matter what I do. Don¡¯t bother with the ¡°customer support¡± either because they will just send you an email with the equivalent ¡°have you turned it off and on again¡±. I¡¯ll stick with my $15 Honeywell humidifier. The positive reviews here are wild because this was the biggest waste of money ever."
437,A little pricey for what you get,Not a bad humidifier the only thing that would be better is if it actually put more missed out than it does on high.. easy the refill since the top comes off. Definitely use some distilled water so it doesn¡¯t scale. The only downfall is the Wi-Fi Bluetooth only works if you¡¯re right next to it!
438,Great Product!,"Does what it¡¯s needed to for the space I¡¯m using, only complaint is that the mist tube is hard to reCh down into to clean, would suggest maybe making the mist splitter removable?"
439,Leaky,"I chose this product because of the glowing recommendations I saw on a number of online sources. I am returning it because water drips from the tank. Fortunately, I set it up on a rimmed tray on my dresser which saved the wood from water damage. When I found a few small puddles around the unit after the first use, I thought maybe I spilled water or didn't have the tank correctly seated. I emptied the remaining water from the tank and base, dried everything, and filled it for the second use. The same thing happened. I could see water beading up at the base of the tank in several spots.
I liked the automatic and sleep modes, but I question the accuracy of the built-in hygrometer as it is varies quite a bit from another hygrometer, although I have no way to know if either is correct. Overall, I think I would have been pleased with it if not for the leaking, which is an obvious deal breaker."
440,Good,"It is a good humidifier. However, it doesn't want to work without hooking up to the wifi. I don't want it hooking up to my wifi, so it is irritating to try to turn it on."
441,It would be great if the humidity sensor worked,"The product size is good. Elegant display. It doesn't make any noise. Great features. And in theory it should be fantastic, EXCEPT for the fact that the auto function will be useless because the HUMIDITY SENSOR DOES NOT WORK, it is not accurate at all. The device is placed according to the manufacturer specifications. It reads a humidity level way above the actual when compared against two other sensors, both of which were at least 30% points below."
442,Well built,"Excellent humidifier! I use it in a 1200 sq ft home with no complaints. Easy to use, and does the job nicely. One thing to note is that you may want to use distilled water and not your tap water (unless it's filtered). I have a lot of calcium in my tap water, which left a white residue on my walls. The calcium content also gave my stovetop an orange flame."
443,it's quiet and it puts moisture in the house,I'm very satisfied
444,Easy Fill Process,"I have several Humidifiers in my house, as I heat part of my home with wood, and that causes extreme dryness. This Humidifier is awesome. You can not hear it running at all. You can shut all of its lights off at night while it continues to to work. The top fill option is the best way to go, it's as easy as popping off the cover and filling it up. A Great purchase!!!"
445,GREAT Customer service,"I was having poor readings of the ambient humidity on auto, thus shutting it down prematurely. After struggling to correct the problem by trying different placements of the unit, time had passed to return to Amazon. After nine months, I contacted the company directly. I was a bit disappointed since I had discarded the original packaging that was necessary for a return. However, in spite of no original packaging, I was contacted back and a replacement was sent. Thank you Levoit."
446,Buttons losing functionality less than 3 months after purchase,"The touch buttons(all the buttons are touch)  have stopped accepting input 90% of the time. This makes it unable to change speeds setting, led settings, do anything."
447,Excellent product,I have 2 other humidifiers in my home.  This is easiest to fill and clean.  Love this product.
448,Defective out of the box!,"Will only run for a few seconds, then low water light flashes and it shuts off. Tried resetting with no success. Seems to be a common problem. I have a replacement coming, will update review then."
449,It works,"Works well and all parts accessible for cleaning. Very quiet. Thumbs up on night feature that allows you to turn off screen and light. Note that in a hard water location (e.g., Colorado), there's going to be some white dust / particulate in the steam unless you use distilled water."
450,Very pleased...preferred to use manual mode as I'm not a techi!,"A bit of a wait for shipping, but really good performance and price."
451,"Sensor indicating amount of water in tank is off, unit shuts off based on bad reading","This seemed like it was going to be a great humidifier, it had a nice output  as is exceptionally easy to clean but it keeps shutting off and indicating there is no water in the tank when the tank is more than half full. I used the low, medium, high settings, not the auto adjust settings so it should have worked with water in the tank. I tried fiddling with the valve and the floats and each time it would work for a bit and shut off. I don¡¯t know where the tank level sensor is or that is can be adjusted. But for that, it would be really great. It¡¯s probably a great unit when the tank sensor functions properly."
452,Works effortlessly on manual,"Syncing with phone was easy, operating by phone is not.  Cleaning is a big effort weekly"
453,"Quiet, works ok, but can't really handle a room","It's ok, but not more, we put it in our bedroom and to actually overcome the dryness it has to work 24/7
Otherwise it's very dry in the room
Omly if it's on 24/7 then after a few days it's ok but not perfect

It works for now, but we'll probably have to replace it next year because the ongoing maintenance of filling it up 2-3 times a day so the room will have some humidity is frustrating

Also, it has to be on high setting
The auto turns off at ~50 level
But since the fumes fall down next to the machine, it gets to 50 quickly but the room is still completely dry
So we have to use the manual high setting

When using the sleep mode, it automatically reverts to auto setting
So it basically turns off for the night
So we can't use the sleep mode and have to cover the light with a box

Basically, it works and is quiet but i would not recommend"
454,Quiet and no extra light,"Haven¡¯t done the cleaning process yet, not looking forward to it."
455,Power/on-off button failed in two days.,"I was quite pleased during initial setup, but then quite disappointed two days later when the Power ""button"" would no longer function. Now I have to plug and unplug it every time to turn it on or off. Therefore, cannot recommend this product."
456,Had to send back.,"We used purified water and still got the white dust/film on everything.  Yesterday I started coughing so back I took a covid test which was negative, then I read another review where a couple ended up in the hospital because of the white dust. We bought 4 of them and we are returning all 4."
457,Schedule function doesn¡¯t work and have had problems with each unit I bought,Bought one and display wouldn¡¯t work right and had it replaced.  Bought a second one and Schedule Off worked but Schedule On wouldn¡¯t work. Had it replaced and Schedule on the new one wouldn¡¯t work at all. Sent the replacement backÿ.
458,"Loved initially, but didn¡¯t last","This worked great for a year, but now it leaks out the bottom and is useless. Only buy if you plan on replacing every year."
459,Good,Setup a little confusing
460,Too complicated,"Although this unit is nice looking, easy to add water, and quiet,  I can't figure out how to turn it on.  Seriously, who needs wireless connection for a humidifier? I just want to turn it off and on with one simple push, and this unit does not oblige.  Sheesh."
461,Ok,"Ok, runs out of water in 36 hrs approx"
462,Arrived broken,"Not sure how much they paid wirecutter for the #1 review, but a disappointment. Display doesn¡¯t turn on, even after resetting. And it doesn¡¯t turn on. It is broken, and it was shipped that wayÿ"
463,Works great and easy to clean.,"The auto feature is great! Love the ease of cleaning it since they should be cleaned regularly. The smart features are a nice plus. The only negative is the humidity sensor isn¡¯t 100% accurate, for me seems to be off 2 to 3 percentage compared to what my Nest shows."
464,Love this room humidifier,"Could not be happier!  Unbelievably quite - If Not for the lights telling me it's working, I wouldn't know it.  I have it on one of my nightstands beside my bed - it is SO WHISPER quite, I only can tell it's operating because of the mist coming out of the top, and the lights telling me it is on ""Auto"" and doing it's thing - NEVER hear it PERIOD.  In a +/- 350 square foot Park Model Trailer (in Tucson, AZ), and it does an awesome job - just from the bedroom location.  I could NOT BE HAPPIER!

I have NOT used the sleep mode, therefore I left it unrated."
465,Ready to use,"I don't know what others are talking about with regards to needing the app or it won't work or whatever - this works right out of the box! Filled it with water, plugged it in, hit the power button and boom, it started right up. It's already set to the Auto setting so you really don't have to do anything at all!"
466,"Great product, performs as advertised","Our bedroom get warmer than the rest of the house, and dryer. We  ought this because it has features which enable us to control the humidity- and therefore mitigate the temperature to some degree. But the main reason for our purchase was the dry skin and sinuses we used to have, but now do not. We might even get another unit for the front room."
467,"Easy to fill , easy to use",Easy to fill easy to use excellent unit
468,Missing warm mist,I like it¡¯s smart functions. Works well with google assistant but it would had been great if it provided warm mist option as other humidifier has option of both cool and warm mist. In winters sometimes having these cool mists disturbs your sleep.
469,"Works a treat, hard to clean.","This is a great humidifier. It pumps out the vapor, the app has not failed me once yet and is easy to to use. It does what it's supposed to and does it well. My rating stands even though I'm about to tell you why it's a pain in my ass.

My only issue with it is keeping it clean. I change the water and rinse it out every night, and I admit that I don't only put the recommended distilled water in it, only tap water. That is admittedly probably where my problem stems from, but I run this thing so much while it's dry as hell in Kentucky this time of year (winter) that I just don't want to have to stock gallons and gallons of distilled water, since it'll go through 2/3 of a tank in one night. I keep it set to auto shut off at 50% humidity, well within the recommended range and it still runs pretty much nonstop. That's not the fault of the app or software, it really is that dry in the winter here.

I keep to the app's suggestion of cleaning it once a week, and have even found myself having to do it more than that with the gross buildup of yellow slime all over the intake and all over the bottom section/reservoir and it's whole assembly. Maybe our water here is gross. Totally plausible, but man, the water in the bottom of this thing gets gross looking after a day of working. Bunch of mung floating in it that I have to rinse out daily.

I admit that this is probably user error, since I'm not running the recommended distilled water in it but it's just not economically feasible, since it'd take a gallon every other day. I know it's not expensive, but damn...I don't have space for 15 gallons of distilled water.

Point is, this thing works great, the app is great and works fine, love that it can be programmed to run at certain times of day and only under certain humidity levels and it absolutely pumps out the steam, much better than my last evaporative fan-based humidifier that was loud as hell. I guess I just want to say that if you want to run tap water in it, prepare to have to clean it ever other day, because the mung builds up quick and you don't want to be breathing that stuff."
470,LEVOIT is amazing!,"I purchased this humidifier a little over a year ago. I turned it on last week and the display came on, there was some slight bubbling, but no mist coming out. I contacted Levoit to request support and they agreed to send a new product after supplying a video of the issue.
We use Levoit humidifiers and air purifiers and will never purchase another brand.
Aside from phenomenal customer service, the product is amazing. Easy to use, clean, and the app is very user friendly. Strongly recommend!"
471,"It works, but adds dust into the air","Ever since I turned this humidifier on, it has caused my HEPA air filter to go into overdrive.  It must be emitting a lot of fine particulates and minerals from the water into the air.  It appears that all ultrasonic humidifiers do this, and then they leave a layer of fine dust on furniture.  If they can't avoid this, the the most I can give any of them is 3 stars.  I may try a wicking humidifier instead, even though those seem like a pain to maintain."
472,Large Tank,"The best thing about this is the large tank, which doesn't need constant refilling. I leave it on its highest setting 24/7 so this is important to me. It's also pretty quiet. I'm a little disappointed that no matter how long I leave it on high, the humidity level won't go above 40%. I don't know the exact square footage of the room, but it's definitely not huge. For now this is fine, but if I wanted a more ideal humidity level I'd need a second humidifier."
473,This will not work if you are using 5G,"The app (VeSync) does not work with this product. I contacted VeSync about the problem and was told that I should go back to 4.2G, that they did not know when, OR EVEN IF, the app would be updated. How is this possible? I'm returning the product to Amazon. I don't know what it will be replaced with, but it DEFINITELY WILL NOT BE ANOTHER LEVOIT humidifier."
474,"This humidifier LEAKS, and now we have to replace our flooring :(","At first I would have given this product five stars.  I really loved the fact that I could operate the humidifier from my phone and the way I could set up a schedule.

I followed the directions on cleaning and maintenance.  However, one night I refilled the humidifier simply by pouring more water into the top.  The next day I went into my son's nursery to find that all of the water had leaked out of the humidifier!  We have laminate wood flooring that isn't water proof.  The flooring is ruined from the water damage and needs replaced now.  I really regret purchasing this humidifier!  I would not recommend this product."
475,It works and it makes it easy to breath.,We use it in our bedroom at night and it makes it easy to breath.
476,Great Product,Love this humidifier! Top fill is so convenient and knowing the level of humidity in the room is helpful.
477,Excellent humidifier,This is the best humidifier I have had. I like the automatic function and how easy it is to refill.
478,Works great so far.,I have only had this humidifier for 5 days. So far no problems. No leaks. Very quite. Simple and clear instructions. Must be cleaned every week.
479,No more static electricity shocks in the houses,"Loved the fact it was so easy to set up,and my hybiscus plants love it to,they perked up the very next day"
480,Arrived defective - returned,"The one I received must not have gone through quality control because it leaked from the inside, flooding the reservoir under the water tank and spilling all over the place. Called for support and was told I¡¯d get a call back the next day. Three days later still no call so I just returned it. I have an older model that works extremely well so this was a disappointment."
481,Work well,App is surprisingly good and is convenient for setting specific wake sleep and humidity settings
482,Good Humidifier over all,"Works well, we run humidifier 5 hours everyday on high and it has not slowed down or leaked.has essential oil tray to enhance product experience."
483,Both leaked,I ordered one and used it for a week before it developed cracks EVERYWHERE!  It was retuned and a new one shipped and this one has no visible cracks but leaks all over.  I¡¯m returning it and hoping for a better experience with a new brand.
484,White dust mess!,"These humidifiers work well as far as humidifiers go. But they leave a fine white dust over everything in the whole house. I have to clean furniture, hardwood floors, even windows, everything, every day. I cleaned my piano yesterday and the picture shows what my piano looked like today when I wrote my name in the dust! I¡¯m returning them."
485,Quiet,"This humidifier is very quiet, and holds a lot of water. Being able to control with an app is great. But, leaves a coating of something all over my house. I did not use distilled water. Maybe that¡¯s the reason.
Strong output of mist, but I did not notice any change in the air , or the effect on my sleeping."
486,Love it when it works as it should,"I wanted a humidifier for my bedroom- this item is the perfect size, and operates very quietly. I've had it a few days, and have already noted a few issues. First, the auto mode- like many others, I find it quite strange that you can only set the auto level from the app. But that aside, the main issue with the auto mode is I'll set it to my target range (usually 45%), and my unit will then very quickly jump from 30% up to 70%, which will then slow/stop the mist because it's over target. I just find it hard to believe it's reaching 70% (!) that quickly when it's 20 degrees outside with a dew point of 11, and it started around 30%.

I do see a little bit of water leaking out at parts, so I also wonder if the drips are messing with the humidity sensor in some way? I'm not sure.

Update- contacted the company, who is informing me that 1) the sensor can be variable and is only approximating and 2) the unit should not be used on carpet as that can mess with the sensor. I have moved it to a non-carpeted area and I'm still having the issue, so unfortunately not a solution here. But, did want to give a heads up if you plan to use this is a carpeted area."
487,This is simply a perfect product.,Just awesome. And the app could not be better either.
488,Happy with purchase,I purchased this product for my living room. It is easy to use and to clean. It does come with an app that I have not tried but I don't need to either. If I have it on Auto it will stop when there is enough humidity in the air and starts back up when it detects it needs humidity. Blows cool mist for sure
489,Very Quiet,"I am generally happy with the Levoit 300S.  It is much quieter than the old Honeywell it replaced, and I like the big top filling 1.5 gallon tank.  The only thing I wish is that it put out even more moisture.  It has a tough time keeping up with the horribly dry Wisconsin winter.
I destroyed the last one by not running mineral free water through it, and not cleaning out the scale that built up.  We have very hard water here, and I even have a water softener.  This time I purchased a  ZeroWater 20 Cup filter to pretreat the humidifier water, and I am hoping to eliminate the white dust, and help extend the life of this humidifier.  So far so good."
490,Leaky pos,Leaked everywhere immediately pos
491,Great product,Definitely have noticed a difference since we have been running this at night in the bedroom great product and recommend
492,It was greatÿuntil month 10..,"Super quiet, great features, easy to clean but it started leaking out the back after 10 months. Heard it dripping one night and it had leaked all over the top of my dresser and down into the drawers and expanded some of the wood on top of my dresser from being wet. Came after a full cleaning and a couple days later it was leaking. Tried to wipe it all down, cleaned it two more times and within 24 hours it would start leaking out the back again. $70 humidifier should last longer than 10 months."
493,Beware of severe leaking,This product worked well for about a week. After filling the tank and putting on the base it completely overflowed and soaked our carpet and posed a fire hazard due to the cord being wet. Would strongly recommend not getting this product. The mechanism uses springs and is a very faulty system
494,High frequency squeal,"Upon turning the unit on for the first time, I was greeted by a high frequency squeal (somewhere in the neighborhood of 9-11KHz). After changing the mist settings between low, medium, and high, I realized it's coming from whatever mechanism is emitting the mist, since the level changes with the setting.
Needless to say, a constant high frequency squeal is not pleasant, and certainly not something I want present in my home at all times."
495,Haven't had it for long,I've only had this for a month or slightly longer but it is working well. Very quiet and easy to load the reservoir. So far it's good.
496,So far so good,"I like how it's easy to use; after seeing my boyfriend have to clean filters to keep things clean, I knew I didn't want that. Refilling is a breeze, and since using it for five days I've only had to refill the tank twice counting today. It runs softly and does have different levels to adjust humidity. The touchscreen is sensitive and doesn't take much force to press a button. The lights display can turn off if you want to use it in your bedroom. There is a lot of white powder when it's used (that's calcium from the water, by the way), so take the directions seriously about keeping away from furniture and other items if you don't want to be dusting your furniture a lot. My hygrometer several feet away doesn't recognize the humidity difference very well, but I notice it because I don't shock my cats as much when I'm petting them. My basement apartment with electric heat was in the upper 20 percent for humidity, and now is much closer to 40 percent.

Note: I haven't cleaned it yet, but if it's a pain in the butt then I'll update this review with that info. All it uses for cleaning is vinegar with an included brush to help clean."
497,Works great!,Has helped with adding humidity alot. Easy to use and very easy to refill.
498,Simple set up and great operation,The humidifier has worked wonders for my sphynx cat¡¯s nose. He¡¯s not as sniffly.
499,Looks are deceiving,Product leaks after first use. Will not recommend this Product.
500,Great humidifier,Easy to use and clean.  Very quiet.
501,Nice but mist not directable,"This humidifier has many nice features including the ability to turn off the display. I like to position the humidifier near my bed and have the mist blow toward my face during the night (the room is too large and open to have any hope of humidifying the whole space).  Unfortunately, the mist on this machine blows almost straight up, so rotating the nozzle has very little effect and the mist floats down right around the machine. It¡¯s no problem in our smaller bedrooms where the whole room can get humidified, but doesn¡¯t work for what I needed."
502,NOT for large room,"This humidifier is decent in every way but one. It doesn't meet the primary reason I bought it, ""for large room"" which is in its title! Our master bedroom is 20x10. Regular height ceilings. I set the humidity to 47%. It will run all night, never meeting that. Using 1/3 - 1/2 tank in that night.
It is completely silent, and I like the scheduling available.. but it doesn't meet the primary reason I bought it."
503,"Great value, quality product!","Great product and top fill, easy to connect and set up schedule, highly recommend!"
504,Great Product and Really Great Customer Service,"Just purchased a second unit because it works so well.  Their customer service is also another reason why I purchased the second unit.  I had broken the first unit by mistake and after emailing with customer service they resolved the issue quickly and without issue, very pleased with my two purchases and highly recommend."
505,comfort,Brange up the Humid in the room to a comfortable level
506,easy to clean,quiet and easy yo refil and clean
507,Works well,I love this humidifier. It works really well and is almost silent. I¡¯ve had two others and they didn¡¯t do the job. This one is great for counteracting the effect of the radiator heater that dries the air.
508,Does not humidify as large an area it claims to,"This unit claims to raise the humidity up to 500 square feet. Barely works up to 5 square feet. The reader on the unit can show one thing but I have a device that tells humidity sitting 12 feet away and it's always at least 20% less than what the unit is saying! That's a huge difference. Upsetting because I bought this in hopes it would take care of 3 rooms on my first floor which are well under 500 sq. Easy to clean, quiet, easy to use. But I'd probably need 2 per room to work like it claims to."
509,Comfort,I love that you can use your phone to control the unit and easy top loading and cleaning
510,"It was excellent for my experience, no more bloody nose.","I liked everything about it, it does not sound like a chopper flying over my house like the other brands."
511,Junk,Hardly misted at all. Humidity never changed. More Chinese junk.
512,Unit does not work with smartphone,"Unlike it is advertises, it does not work with a smartphone. I went back and forth with their technical support and they could not get it to connect. The goal was to monitor the humidity and notify me when the water well was empty. Never got it to work. Returned it."
513,Quiet and works as intended,"Quiet, works well and appears to humidify the dry air in my home."
514,"One works very well, the other not","We bought two of these.  One of them works very well and maintains a comfortable humidity level in a rather large room.  The other, which is in our bedroom, barely produces any mist at all, even on the highest setting, and does not seem to have any effect on the room's humidity.  We have cleaned it twice, gone through all the troubleshooting steps, and it still does not work properly.  The three-star rating is the average of a five-star rating for the one and a one-star rating for the other."
515,Impossible to clean easily,"Almost impossible to get into small areas for thorough cleaning. Small brush supplied is useless.
Cannot get to speak to someone in support. Only email.

Cannot recommend this product."
516,Why a touchscreen interface?,"Why do we need a touchscreen interface for a simple device such as this? Frustrating controls that I can't find by feel. NOT accessible device, bad user experience. Simple tactile off switch that's findable in the dark AND accessible is what's needed. Stupid."
517,Very little noise and great for small rooms,easy to use. does not interfere when sleeping. noise is a whisper.Like it.
518,Me encanto,Me gusta como hkmidifica el ambiente y la luz nocturna hace verde fresco limpio y hasta rom¨¢ntico. Me encanta que solo le agrego agua y no la tengo que levantar toda como otros humidificadores que no los puedo cargar por el peso. Este esta S_PER!!! Me encanto
519,"Good idea, poor product","I want to like this unit. The ability to set an automatic program to turn on every night is great, except it always drains the lower chamber and faults for no water even when there is water in the tank itself. I have to reposition the tank and then you can hear it refill the lower chamber. This is after it worked the night before and it hasn't been moved since.
The touch part buttons are not very responsive either. Takes a few tries to turn it on.
I'd love to find a good old school power button or knob to select high low off functions. I'll probably end up returning this if it keeps happening"
520,Best ever,Best vaporizer ever
521,Almost perfect,"I love this humidifier. The app is easy to use, very minor bugs. The sound is barely detectable and what you do hear is a NOT high pitched at all. The humidity sensor is off but consistent so it keeps the level pretty normalized."
522,nice humidifier,i like this humidifier because of the large capacity and because it¡¯s a top fill. I also really like that i can control it from the app and it tells me when it¡¯s out of water. the only downside is the humidity reads slightly higher than my humidistat so i have to adjust accordingly. i also wish there was a way for it to turn the humidity down instead of off when it reaches a certain level to hold it there.
523,WIFI connection with phone is great.,Great control with phone via WIFI connection.
524,GREAT HUMIDIFIER!!,"This unit is SOOOOO quiet, puts out a tremendous volume of vapor for its size, and has so many wonderful features.  I would HIGHLY recommend this humidifier."
525,Very efficient,Very easy to clean the noise level
526,Does the job for us.,"So far, it¡¯s working well for us. It¡¯s easy to clean & so easy to use, using my phone!"
527,Doesn¡¯t work - don¡¯t waste your money,Only works for 5 minutes then shuts off for no reason. Tried to adjust every setting and didn¡¯t fix the problem. Returning after 1 day of owning it
528,"Quiet, gets moisture into the room air quickly!",Does a fantastic job getting moisture in the dry winter air/heat.
529,SO easy to clean!,"This humidifier is nothing super different than any other humidifier, but the ability to get inside with your hand and actually scrub the entire water reservoir is amazing!"
530,Works wellÿ until it gives a false ¡°Tank Empty¡± error,"We bought this humidifier 2 weeks ago. Since then, it has triggered false ¡°tank empty¡± notifications at least 4 times. Each time the tank is 50% full. This is really annoying. What are we doing wrong? We bought this humidifier because supposedly it can tell us when to change the water. But it¡¯s so unreliable, we are considering returning the unit."
531,Perfect for my needs,"I replaced another humidifier with this one because it was so hard to clean.

I am using distilled water in this one as was recommended.
Everything works as intended. The app is great. I control it with Alexa. Humidity setting seems to be fine but I haven¡¯t checked it with anything else.

I¡¯m perfectly happy with it."
532,Water,Good product but it does use a lot of water.
533,Great design and least maintenance.,Great design. Top fill water tank. Remote control from mobile phone. Connected to Alexa. Remind me to clean when needed.
534,Love this humidifier - only downside is the intricate cleaning process.,"I really like the humidifier overall. Great capacity for water & while I actually prefer more noise due to the louder apartment I live in, I don't think it's very loud. Like the title states, the cleaning process is pretty intricate. There are few nooks I feel like I can't get to as well even with a q-tip or toothbrush."
535,Excellent Machine,Works great.  Easy to set up. Very quite
536,"Works as advertised, and the Bluetooth feature is a nice touch... don't need another mini-remote.","I've had this humidifier for just about a year and it continues to work as advertised.  I like the Bluetooth feature and the phone app; I don't need another mini-remote to lose.  It's easy to clean, and I haven't experienced any leaks at all."
537,Wow I can breath!,I woke up today feeling great from this humidifier! I was thinking about buying their smaller one but the way the heat is in my apartment I splurged on the bigger one and it¡¯s a game changer. I love how easy it is to fill up and the app is great because I can check on the humidity level without having to even look. Really enjoy it!
538,Great Humidifier!,I really like this humidifier.  It runs quiet and has a larger tank so it lasts longer than my previous one.  It has a light and automatically shuts down when the tank is empty.  I am very satisfied with this product!
539,Great portable humidifier!,"I like the fact that it is portable, very quiet and has 3 vapor settings"
540,Will sell your email address,"You have to register with an email address to use any of the smart features.  I used a unique email address and immediately -- within hours -- started getting deluged with spam to that address.  Despicable business practices.  Seems to be a fine humidifier, thus the two stars, but can't support this company or recommend this product."
541,Highly recommend,"Top reviewed at multiple well-known review sites, including NYT. Agrees. Thinking of getting more for the other bedrooms."
542,"Does the job, no leaks, no issues.","The humidifier works just as advertised, great app interaction. I've automated it to go on daily and keep a certain humidity in the master bedroom.

No issues with leaking, read the instructions and fill it up correctly, it'll work as intended."
543,"LEVIOT Humidifier; Fabulous, Fast & Quiet. #1","I upgraded the humidifier to LEVOIT after my mandatory research was complete. Wow, this humidifier will exceed your expectations, ¡°zero noise¡±, 2 day bin and it fills the room in a flash. The price (minus inflation) reflects the result;  my face does not look red in the morning from forced air heat. This room is big and within minutes there is a noticeable bump up on the comfort level. This is a purchase I would recommend."
544,100% recommend- Great quality!,"This is definitely a smart purchase. This is very easy to clean, It is very quiet, and it is sleek and durable. The way this is built shows how it¡¯s meant to last a long time. It doesn¡¯t even look like an average humidifier, it can easily blend into your home.

I¡¯ve gone through many humidifiers so I am thrilled with how great this one works! 100% recommend"
545,Owo,"Best item I bought from Amazon 
It work fine"
546,It's easy to operate,"I love this humidifier, it's easy to operate with the app and also it tells you when it needs water and needs to be cleaned."
547,Worth it,"It holds a lot of water, adjustable settings, sleek looking . A must"
548,Leaked all over floor,"After using it for 30 days, it leaked all over my floor.  The water was coming from the base.  I filled it correctly like always.  Very disappointed considering the cost."
549,Very easy to use and fill.,"This humidifier is totally quiet, easy to fill, and increases the humidity in a 300 sq ft bedroom by 10% over about 3 hours as measured from 18 feet away. Of course, the bedroom door must be closed or that extra humidity escapes into the rest of the house. Overall, it's impressive for how quiet it is and how simple it is to fill from my RO unit in the kitchen."
550,Started out good.,"Started out working great. After a few weeks it started to leak, but I contacted company. They replaced it with in a few days, no questions ask. This is what I call customer service.  Highly recommend!"
551,Very good,"It¡¯s very calm and quiet and very easy to use with app on my mobile, working great. I rally love it specially in winter, healthy choice for my skin and breathing system"
552,Great Humidifier,I highly recommend this product.  I have two that work as advertised and a third on the way.
553,Great Humidifier,Humidifier and app both work well.
554,Sleep mode not working properly,"The main problem with this device is that the display will turn back on in the middle of the night. I always turn the display off before bed. Yet, it keeps turning on and it¡¯s very bright and wakes me up. I wish it would have the display off the whole time."
555,Levoit humidifier is the best I¡¯ve ever had!!!,I liked everything about it
556,Love this machine,"I love this humidifier.  Not only can I breathe better, but I can control the humidifier from my phone. It's easy to keep clean and easy to fill with a large capacity tank. I use a gallon jug to fill it up. You can also put it on a schedule so you can set it and forget it...until your phone let's you know it's time to refill it."
557,"Refills and restarts quite easy, easy to clean.",Does a good job on my 1250 sq ft apartment.
558,Missing tray,"I was looking forward to my humidifier , since I have allergies : extremely disappointed , it¡¯s missing the tray , I had to go to Best Buy and buy one, instead of rushing check your items before you deliver, I was hoping to have relief from allergies , instead I¡¯m frustrated ,"
559,sure get it,"It ahs been working fine every day for about 2 weeks. Have not used the wifi feature and probably wont,  not sure the benefit of that. It is easy for the most part to clean. there are a couple of crevices tat take some work. wish it had some feature to keep the mold from growing. surprised how quick it needed a good clean.

out put is great holds almost 2 gallons."
560,"Easy to use, easy to control.",The app makes this humidifier the most versatile I have ever used.
561,Best Humidifier!,Love that I can control it from my phone and Alexa!
562,Too much white dust!,"This product does humidify the air; however, I cannot stand the white dust on everything.  I have used it for a month but no more. I have to dust multiple times a day and even dust the inside of my windows.  This is just unacceptable. Wish I could return it, but since it does work, I will just be out the purchase price."
563,Stopped working after 1 day,"Keeps saying water level is low no matter how full the water tank is. There is no additional trouble shooting to find online besides removing tank, filling it, and putting it back on the base. The product is great if it were to work properly.

Update: started pouring water out of the base."
564,You need a humidifier get this!,"Humidifier works! I would buy another if I had use for it!
Only downside I can think of is cleaning inside the steam part there¡¯s a little piece that clicks off if you didn¡¯t know you¡¯d miss that during a cleaning.
Use distilled water for it it¡¯s even better no mineralization when cleaning."
565,Wish I could give it a 10!,This humidifier does it all! I set it on my wifi and programmed the unit to turn on and off. The only thing I do is clean it when the app tells me to. Best humidifier highly recommend! I love simplicity
566,Would give 10 stars if possible.,"I love this humidifier! I wish I had it in every bedroom instead of the ones we previously bought.

The tank is HUGE over 1 gallon in size (roughly 1.5 gallon). It¡¯s super easy to fill and incredibly easy to wipe out.

I have screenshots of the app you can use with it. I setup a schedule so it runs while I sleep and turns off in the morning. It also has ability to set a target humidity and will turn off when reached. The screen turns on and off for display so if you like it dark while sleeping it¡¯s off.

The aroma of this is nice. Not too much but enough to smell it across the room. If you want the smell to be super strong this won¡¯t give that much unless it¡¯s close to you (I did the 10 full drops).

When the old humidifiers die I¡¯ll be buying more of these!"
567,it works !!!,the room smells great..
568,Works great,"Purchased this for our bedroom, we live in Colorado so the dryness is bad, works great so far."
569,Very silent humidifier,I love the top fill feature. There is little slots  on sides to pick up to clean & refill. It¡¯s also not too heavy to lift.  It¡¯s very quite. I don¡¯t use night light but I could see where it would be useful for anyone that does.
570,Best Humidifier,This is the best humidifier that I have ever owned. The auto feature works really well and makes sure that you never have too much moisture in the air. My family loves it so much that I went back and bought two more for different areas in the house!
571,Works great,Easy to set up an works as stated
572,Immediately broke,"Everything was initially fine and setup was easy, but within an hour the unit stopped producing mist. Everything seemed to be functioning as normal and the fan continued to run but no mist was being produced. Let it run overnight on the high setting and in the morning the water level had not gone down at all and still no mist was being produced. Sent it back and will go with a different brand"
573,loved it until it broke,It worked great until it leaked water onto the floor and would not work again.  Levoit says it's under warranty but they haven't gotten back to me yet.
574,"Good humidifier rendered useless by ""smart"" features","Great device overall, but it won't reliably do the one thing I bought it to do, which is to keep my room humid overnight.
Even after disabling all of the default auto-shut off smart actions, this device will run for 30 minutes and then think the tank is empty, and turn off until you reseat the tank. Because of that I wake up with a sore throat from the dry air overnight.

Back to the drawing board for another humidifier that will reliably run overnight without needing to babysit it every hour."
575,Easy and hassle free!," Easy peasy folks. Take out packing, fill up tank, plug it in and ready to go. Starts mist immediately. No sound at all. Display large, clear, and simple to use. 5 mins and I can breath better already. Love it."
576,Great for sleeping,"My last humidifier had a loud fan, and made dripping water noises all night.  I felt like I was sleeping in a cave.  This thing is designed for sleeping.  No fan noise, no dripping noise, and a total black sleep mode.  The wifi works great, but really I just used it once to set up a recurring schedule to turn it on at night.  Recommend!"
577,Love this humixifier,"I bought one for each of our bedrooms. They¡¯re pricey, but they¡¯re the best I¡¯ve had. They stay filled for at least 2-3 nights on low."
578,Good product,You just do not add water to the tank.  You have to pull the tank off.  Kindof a pai_.  Taking the tank off everytime You add water is inconvenient
579,Quit and easy to fill,I like the internet connectivity. The machine is extremely quiet and easy to fill. The tank lasts for about a day.
580,I've had many humidifiers over the years. And this one is the best I've ever owned.,"This humidifier is so easy to use. I love the app that it comes with. Filling it, cleaning. It is super easy. It's extremely quiet. You don't hear a thing."
581,"Easy to refill, no heavy lifting","This is a replacement for the other Levoit humidifier, a bit more expensive, that has a warm mist mode. I never used the warm feature, and don't miss it. Two other differences: 1. MEH: This model has no remote, but expects you to sync your phone with it, or just manually set the controls on the machine itself.  2. YAY!!! You can fill this humidifier simply by lifting off the top panel.  With the other model, you had to remove the water reservoir, unscrew the bottom access cover - which sometimes just did not want to budge despite my adding teflon tape to the thread - and then replace the filled tank on the humidifier. A full tank may be too heavy for some users, but with this model, you just keep adding water without removing the tank.
Any humidifier can have parts that require a brush (included) to clean, so I gave this one four stars, but it is easier to clean than the other model."
582,Perfect,"We live in the Southwest - a very dry climate.  My skin was itching every night, even waking me from a nice sleep.  Checking reviews on Amazon, I bought 2 of these humidifiers -- one for bedroom and one for living room.  They are much easier to use and to maintain than the brand I bought 2 years ago.  Quiet, easy to fill, and a ""fill"" will last 12 hours or more."
583,Life Saver!,"My house was so dry, I had severe dry eyes.  This humidifier puts out a lot of moisture on high!  My eyes have felt a lot better since we started using this 24/7!  Very quiet and even has a small internal light that looks really nice at night."
584,Very quiet,"I bought this for a large bedroom with cathredal ceilings, but I don't think it's robust enough for a room that size.  On the plus side, it is so quiet you can barely hear it. It has a noise suppressor built into it.  It generates a good deal of mist that you can control.  You can schedule a turn-on time time and/or a turn-off time with the app, as well as adjust the humidity level, put it in night mode (display turns off), or turn on its night light.  The app reminds you when to clean it (once a week).

As for the negatives, the display that shows the humidity level is really bright.  It lights up the room.  I want to see what the humidity level is when I wake up so I've left the display on all night but I wish they had an option to dim it. Your choices are - very bright or not at all.  I don't use the night light and don't see the point.  Regarding cleaning, there are several parts to disassemble and the instructions mention de-scaling it with 3 cups of vinegar. Is that supposed to be done as part of the weekly cleaning?  I've cleaned it every week but haven't descaled it yet (after one month of use) and haven't seen any problems.
 As I mentioned earlier, this would probably work GREAT in a small room, but in our large bedroom I haven't been able to get the humidity up past 40% (I wish I could get it to 45%), and 95% of the time this winter it's only gotten between 30-36%."
585,Best humidifier I¡¯ve owned! Auto mode is great,"Love this thing. Auto mode is perfect. It monitors the humidity level and turns on and off on it¡¯s own. Sleep mode turns off the display. The app is great and connection to Google home allows me to control it with my voice.

One of my better Amazon purchase lately."
586,Worst humidifier I¡¯ve ever owned,"I have a medium sized room and this humidifier does not raise the humidity at all. It does not even show the correct percentage. Every time I turn it on, my allergies get really bad and i have to turn it off. Not recommended."
587,super quite,works great happy I got it.
588,Noisy and did not work,Disliked e erything
589,Simple,We have had several humidifiers and this one is simple and quite. Just got it so don¡¯t know how it will be long term but so far so good.
590,"Garbage, leaks everywhere","I bought this unit, on advice from Wirecutter. The Levoit humidifier is absolute garbage. I bought it even though the Amazon reviews clearly state this pile of crap leaks. I wanted to believe Wirecutter. DO NOT BUY! It ruined my son¡¯s bookshelf and all his books in less than 30 minutes. I filled the tank for the third time since owning it (approx 2 weeks) an left the room. I¡¯m glad I happened to come back in when I did so it didn¡¯t empty the whole flipping tank into the floor.
When I checked for the leak it looks like it was coming from underneath the unit, not from base and tank connection.
So irritated!"
591,Great,"Using for my lungs, I have CHF"
592,+ a night light,"It is a great product, just the display digits are too bright. Feels like I have a night light on in the room."
593,Quality product that would benefit from two engineering modifications,"This humidifier works well, looks good and is very easy to operate. The one thing that it needs is a review by engineers and manufacturers to see if the interior portions of the applicance can be more easily cleaned. tTwo areas to examine. The tiny brush provided by the manufacturer isn't up to the job. The foam brush designed to clean wine glasses works much better as this type of brush is able to remove any scale or residue. But it doesn't get into the tiny crevices that need to be swabbed out. Perhaps the interior could be modified to have fewer corners and more rounded shapes?  Additionally, the clear foam filter is very hard to clean. The manufacturer should sell the device with additional filters until they find a material that doesn't stain so quickly. I used water filtered through a Brita filter instead of tap water or distilled water."
594,The best cool mist,
595,. THE APP DOES NOT WORKÿ,"Have been able to reconnect to app. However, when app is connected and in control, the unit will not stay on. Just keeps shutting down entirely and will not come back on. The only way the unit will remain on is to remove the app. THE APP DOES NOT WORKÿ"
596,"All in 1, Easy to fill, clean, use humidifier",Quite unit. Fill tank lasts for days. Easy fill tank. I use a cup to top it off & don¡¯t have to remove the water tank. So much easier! I love the Bluetooth app feature. It allows me to set a daily schedule to turn on/off on its own. I¡¯d recommend anyone buy this!
597,Fills from the top,The fact that it fills from the top is a huge improvement!  I¡¯m really pleased with this humidifier- I¡¯ve been a Levoit user/fan for several years!
598,Great Humidifier,"Great humidifier, quiet, easy to keep filled, Really great product. also have their air cleaner."
599,"This humidifier is great, but the tank is very small",I love almost everything about this humidifier.  But the tank is so tiny that I end up re-filling it more than once a day.
600,Junk!,"Used 2 days. Came home yesterday to find 2 sides of the water reservoir crack from top to bottom. Water soaked hard wood floors. Now today with it sitting on kitchen counter empty and not used,  2 other sides of the reservoir are cracked. Complete garbage"
601,Very Quite,This is perfect for a single large room.  Very quite during sleeping
602,Effective,I bought this humidifier for my bedroom and am very happy with it.  It is super quiet and very easy to clean plus not unsightly.
603,Love this.,We have in the bedroom.  It¡¯s so quiet.  And can put in sleep mode the lights go off.  It is so great.
604,Worth for money spent !!,it's very simple to use and I really like the various setting from phone . We mainly set ours at the desired humidity level and just let it do it's thing.
605,Extremely quiet and puts out a lot of mist.,Does the job well.  Easy to refill.
606,Worked well,"I like that you fill the water up side up, as oppose to from bottom for most humidifiers"
607,Great Humidifier,"I bought this humidifier to use it in my room as I¡¯ve been  suffering from bad allergies, Just in my second day using the product and I am not disappointed, this unit does the job, I love that you can use essential oil in the small tray located in the back of the unit, i also love the way you can control all the unit functions and timer with the app, this was a plus for me."
608,Excellent support and works as advertised,"So when I initially received the product, it was a dud, it kept complaining that it there was no enough water. Contacted support and after a couple of exchanges they sent me a replacement with no hassle. The replacement unit works perfectly. Previous humidifiers and we've used a lot of different ones all had us filling up water on a near daily basis. And filling them up required turning them upside down which is a choir. I love the way this model can easily fill from the top, can easily connect to Alexa, can set schedules, and properly maintain a cerain range of humidity in the room. Definitely made our lives easier than all our previous models."
609,Had issues connecting to the Wi-Fi,I normally don¡¯t write reviews to the point that I got so frustrated and I had to write this review overall I would say the product is absolutely great but it¡¯s major downfall would be problems connecting the device to the Wi-Fi spent several hours repeatedly trying again for failure I will advise not to get this product if your main reason is to use it with Wi-Fi other than that it¡¯s a great product
610,Great Humidifier,One of the best humidifiers I've ever tried.  Having dry eyes at night keeps me awake but this humidifier has helped and is easy to use due to the phone app to control it.
611,Perfect,Love everything about it
612,Best humidifier ever!!!,I bought this for my husband who gets nose bleeds a lot when the air is too dry. I never can remember to turn these things off though so I wanted one that had a timer. Well this one has a timer but you can also set it on an auto setting to where it comes on and turns off when the air is at the level of humidity you set it for. It has a light inside the water tank which can be on or off. It tells you the humidity In your room on the display. There are various levels and you can set a schedule to turn off the display when going to sleep. I don¡¯t hear it at all when we are alseep. My husband can¡¯t tell sometimes when it is on because it¡¯s so quiet.
613,"Not a good ""Essential Oil Diffuser""","This item is a fairly good humidifier, but is a LOUSY ""Essential Oil Diffuser"".  It never provided enough scent for me to detect unless my face was right in the mist!  You cannot detect the scent in the rest of the room!"
614,Easiest humidifier I have had,"I was looking for a top-fill easy to clean large room humidifier and am glad I selected this one. I have not downloaded the app yet but so far I like the sleek clean look (I got the black color) and I like all of the settings (auto, low, medium, high). I love the digital display and the light."
615,Works well and quiet,I have it in a 14x14 room works well.
616,Amazingly quiet!,"I can't believe how quiet this machine is. The mist is very fine and cool to the touch. This is a huge improvement from my last humidifier. Once you read the instructions, it's easy to figure out the settings too."
617,It's NOT For Mid-Large Rooms,"I really needed a unit that would cover my whole 1-bd apartment and all the research brought me to this unit with a listed coverage of about 500 ft/2. (it does not do the job).

But with that aside, it really is a good unit. having an ""Auto""  mode has become indispensable in my life these days (AC / Heating / Air Purifier / Fan / etc...) as it tends to be far more energy-efficient for a targeted preset with the unit going on off as needed to keep that lever. This definitely does that and it does it well.

Be warned, however, if you are using an air purifier with air quality detectors, the vapor from the humidifier will interfere with the reading giving you a heavy high false positive due to the size of the water vapor, which is over 3 microns in size."
618,Not very functional,"Bought this for our master Bedroom and had to return.  The Humidifier turns off constantly, does not allow you to set humidity, and reads no water when the tank is full.  I would suggest buying a humidifier like Pure as they work way better and NOT get one that tried to be smart as the smart features make it useless.  So surprised they don't just let you run manually no matter what."
619,Best ever,"I have had so many home humidifiers and this is the best ever. Large water capacity, easy to fill, just easy all around. The only disappointment I have is that the sleep mode changes in the mist mode. Normally I keep mine on low but when I click on sleep mode it automatically bounces up to auto which can bounce your missed up to 50%. If you don¡¯t mind it that high then it¡¯s OK. I have a small house but I have three stationed in three different rooms and I keep my humidity around 28% which may be low for some that is perfect for meAnyway it¡¯s highly recommended"
620,Best all round humidifier,Look no further. This humidifier will be your best friend. This quiet machine with sleek and aesthetic design makes for a perfect addition to any room that you need to make that much cozier with more humid air. Tank size and control from the app on your phone make it the best on the market today. This is THE home 1-room humidifier that sets the barÿI challenge you today find a better one. Won¡¯t happen.
621,Emits very heavy mineral deposits,"We have very hard well water.  Our evaporative type humidifier was requiring wick/filter replacement quite frequently so we opted to try this Levoit ultrasonic humidifier. Using our softened but not filtered tap water the ultrasonic humidifier emitted an extremely heavy and visible white ""fog"" of minerals in the air and on all surfaces.  By recirculating the mineral laden air through our hot air furnace we were having to replace the furnace air filter almost monthly.  Based on the amount of water we were using daily it was not feasible to purchase distilled water for the humidifier.  We have decided that the evaporative type humidifier is more cost effective, results in the same management of humidity level, and maintains a cleaner environment.  We have reduced the frequency of replacing the wick/filter of the evaporative humidifier by about 30% by rinsing the filter once between replacements. This has reduced the cost of replacement wick/filters somewhat. And, we are back to replacing the furnace filter about every six months."
622,reported humidity is outrageously overstated and it stopped working after 3 days,"As my picture shows, this humidifier that claims to have humidistat functions only works (marginally) if you set humidity target a full 20 percent over what you want.  Liar liar pants on fire that apparently tries to trick buyers who believe what the unit reports for humidity and don't have their own humidity sensors.

Addition after three days: stopped working entirely.  Not sure why..  bluetooth failed first and then unit stopped working even manually.  Highly recommended that potential buyers look elsewhere.  This unit would be great if it actually worked with the features it advertises.  Sadly it doesn't work at all for long."
623,Quiet humidifier,"Works well, quiet and keeps the humidity level in mid to high 40's"
624,Easy to Fill,"Got this as my old humidifer was starting to make weird noises.

Overall, very pleased with it.  The best thing is you can. Refill it easily without removing the tank, which is nice for topping it off before bed or before leaving for work.  Wifi connectivity works fine but does not show tank level (no sensor for it, so understandable).  It gives an alert when the tank empties and reminds you to clean it.

Output is good, as well.  It isn't phenomenal but plenty for a living space."
625,Nice unit,"It works great, quiet and easy to use. Good looking as well"
626,Received dirty and obviously used device,"Unethical and unsafe to use. Obviously used product, still visibly wet inside the tank, with mold growing under the lid...."
627,Works great,I¡¯ve had this a few months now and have no complaints. My house is very dry in the winter and this works wonders
628,Very quiet love it,We bought this for our bedroom and are so pleased with how there truly isn¡¯t any noise when it is running! Very happy with the machine.
629,Humidifier,Works Great
630,Automatic mode,I bought it because automatic futures. But measurements show to high level compare with other humidity meters. So it will newer turn on in automatic mode.
631,works well,Just got this a week ago so can't speak to durability but so far this device is great.  It is so quiet that I don't hear it at all during the day and at night it's a low white noise that isn't bothersome at all and hardly noticeable. The mist coming out is a good amount and yet is so light that it doesn't damage any of the furniture or floor around it. Love the auto function so you don't over humidify and can safely just leave it on.
632,App is full of ads,No way to remove ads. The humidifier works fine.  Several times a day the required app send phone notifications about random products.  I paid 100 for this product only to be spammed by ads.  Would NOT buy again
633,It IS a humidifier.,It works as advertised. I put water in and get cool steam out. Five out of Five. It also has a timer that I do not use.
634,SO QUIET!!!,BEST HUMIDIFIER I HAVE EVER HAD
635,I love my humidifier and can recommend it!,
636,Wonderful humidifier," I was in the market to find a quiet humidifier for my plant babies! Ive owned this humidifier for a month now and I haven't had any issues whatsoever. The app is great and also connects to my google home as well. Its super quiet and the night feature is great. The mist is beautiful and full, but also not over the top. I had my mail station set next to it for a couple weeks and none of the paper was touched by water. Cleaning is super easy once you get the hang of it. I personally do not use it for aromatic use, (strictly for the plants!) But there is an option in the back for a slot with an aromatic area! Ive opted to only used distilled water and so far no issues. I am also a cat owner and regularly brush my kitty children, but have definitely noticed a sheen to their coats. Im pretty sure everyone in the house is benefiting from this humidifier! I definitely trust the company and the product!"
637,Very quiet,Love the smart feature to be able to turn on from phone.
638,Love it,Very quiet and very easy to clean
639,Mostly good with some issues,"cons:
* REFILLING - when you remove the tank to fill it at the sink, water always drips off the bottom. The bottom isn't smooth which would lend itself to wiping with a towel, so it's pretty much unavoidable. I have to wipe water off the floor after I fill it up.
* NOISE - the humidifier is quiet, but if you have good hearing, then you can hear a high pitch whine.

pros:
* CAPACITY - it holds a lot of water
* HUMIDISTAT - you can set the target humidity to maintain"
640,Very well thought out design!,The reservoir is large and easy to thoroughly clean. Some of the quirky nuisances have been solved. The night light has two settings and display screen can be turned on and off for total darkness. It is truly silent.  The smart feature allows you to turn on the nightlight on and off from bed. Would recommend to anyone.
641,Beware: this product leaked and damaged my furniture,"After following their start-up instructions carefully, pressing the ""on"" button and observing it for a few minutes, I walked away to do another chore.  In 30 minutes, it had leaked 1/2 its water, ruining the wood table on which it sat and soaking the carpet underneath.  Cannot return it fast enough and with enough anger: I'll get my money back but not the table."
642,Only lasted 3 about months,Loved it while it worked. Just died out of the blue. Right after the returned date closed.
643,Love this! Best humidifier I¡¯ve owned!,"I absolutely love these and own 2, on in living room one in bedroom. I love the smart app so I can control them from my phone, as a disabled person this is super helpful. I also love the top fill, makes life so much easier!!! Love these! Very affordable for a great humidifier! Buy it!"
644,Pathetic,"Received  Classic 300S humidifier on Sunday, worked for a total of one hour before red alert icon began blinking and shut the unit down, tried to restart but icon flashed again then shut down. Called customer service, recording said phones would not be answered until 1-6-22, called today and another message said phones would not be answered till 1-10-22. Emailed support and two days later received a response to send photos of issue, sent a quick video and picture of manufactures plate as of yet no response. Returning item today, pathetic customer product support. Buyer beware!!.
Dick Leathers"
645,Mist level adjustments are limited,"I was very disappointed to find there are only 3 levels of mist and the lowest level is too much. In the past, I had an old model that allowed me to adjust the mist to any level."
646,Doesn't work,I like the humidifier when it works but it constantly shuts off even in the modes other than automatic...very frustrating!
647,FANTASTIC!,"Awesome product!  This is one of the best humidifiers I¡¯ve ever owned.  I absolutely love the smart phone connectivity features, and the ease of use.  It really does an incredible job, and it¡¯s very quiet.  I sleep with it on, and it really has made my nights far more restful!  I can breathe!  __  I highly recommend a purchase of this unit.  It¡¯s awesome!"
648,Works great!,"Like this one a lot. Great steam, having the different levels is nice and knowing the amount of humidity helps. Easy to clean and doesn¡¯t need to be refilled as often plus easy to refill-poor on top."
649,Great for dry heated homes!,Provides great moisture for dry heat. Helps with my dry throat. Loves that it works with cellphone and Alexa!
650,Extremely quiet and has a good strong flow of mist,This has to be the most quiet humidifier I have ever used! It has a good strong stream of steam/mist. There are three settings for the mist. I like that it has a nightlight on it too. The tank is large so it holds a good amount of water. I am very pleased with it and would highly recommend this product.
651,The best humidifier I have ever owned,"UPDATE:
Some have complained about leaking after refilling the tank. I personally have not had this experience but I have a guess (only a guess) as to why that is happening. When you remove the water tank there is some water in the base. I personally unplug each device and pour out the excess water. I also rinse the base and the tank before refill. My guess is that there was water in the base and when the refilled tank was put on top it caused the extra water to leak. I have no way of confirming if this is what happened for other customers, but I recommend pouring out remaining water from the tank and the bases each time before refilling the water tank.

ORIGIONAL:
I recently bought 3 of these to replace three humidifiers I had. I had two different modules from different manufactures but both not only got dirty but were hard to clean.

I bought this model simply for how easy it looked to clean and it does not disappoint. The opening is HUGE. All of the parts are easy to get to. Beyond that it is feature rich. It is a smart humidifier that easily works with both Alexa and Google. The most surprising part was the app. Most smart devices come with terrible apps. Not only is the app easy to use and has great features, but it made it easy to register for the warranty right in the app. It also has the manual in the app. I have neither seen either feature in ANY app. I now wish all apps contained the manual.

The automatic setting on the humidifier works wonderfully. I set a schedule to turn off it's display at night and turn it back on in the morning. My son loves that it has a built in night light. I love that you can turn it off. All electronics should allow you to turn off all the lights.

The only thing that could have made it batter is if it came with a humidifier cleaning cartridge. I bought a set that looks like fish. Now it looks like I have a small fish tank.... which is wonderful."
652,Had high hopes but disappointed,"My biggest complaint about this humidifier is the automatic mode.  Apparently it's supposed to spray mist below 50% humidity.  Humidity as low as 43% and it still doesn't go on automatically.  So, using the night mode is useless and I have to put something in front of the display to keep from being blinded at night.  Manual modes work fine.  Overall, not worth the money and I'd return it but we threw out the packaging."
653,Easy to fill and take care of. #1.,Best I have ever had. I Have had a lot of humidifiers and my time.
654,love it,I live in dry California and am loving having this in my bedroom.
655,"It is not filter-less, but it's otherwise good","I have three of these and have been using one almost every night for two months, and one intermittently for two months. The humidifier is very good. The light is bright for nighttime, and when I set it to ""night mode,"" it ends up turning off, so I just cover the light or turn it around. I bought these humidifiers b/c they are supposed to be filter-less. However, there is definitely a filter in there, and it is now VERY orange-colored after two months of use. When I contacted customer service about buying replacement filters, Levoit was confused as to what I was talking about, insisting there was no filter. Then, after I sent them photos, they told me to soak it in vinegar and water, which I did, to no avail. So, just know that at some point, you're going to have to jury rig yourself a new filter."
656,Just works!,"We've owned a number of humidifiers over the years, and this one beats 'em all. Simple to operate (especially from the app), easy to clean, easy to fill, and it just works. So glad we got it!"
657,Shouldn¡¯t need an app to use this,The humidifier works as advertised but the fact you need the app to make certain adjustments like the auto setting % is ridiculous and unnecessary.  Not everything has to be connected to my phone.  Also the internal hygrometer varies from my calibrated hygrometer wildly and shouldn¡¯t be used for anything serious.
658,Works great! A Polished product from levoit,Works great. Easy to load the water into the tank. Whisper quite when in use. The app controls work nicely and has a scheduling function. Only issue ive had is that the top doesn't secure that well to the base when youre moving it fully loaded. You have to becareful or else you might spill
659,Love this model!,"I purchased this for my bedroom to help with my plants that require high humidity. I thought the app was a gimmick, but I love it. I can adjust multiple aspects through my phone. Super convenient. You fill water from the top, which seems like no big deal but is a great feature. I think it¡¯s great and liked that this has a lower price point. I accidentally sent my husband a link for another Levoit humidifier for Christmas. It doesn¡¯t top fill or have the app. It had a remote, but who needs a separate remote?!  I returned it for another one of these."
660,Good except for a few things,"My wife and I bought a total of six of these. some came with a water filter inside the tank. Some didn't. Called the company. One person said that filter was discontinued on later models. Another said the water filter was a NEW feature. Do NOT use the app on your cell phone to control the unit. It is vulnerable to hackers getting into your phone. I don't need that feature. I like that it's top fill. It works pretty good, but one star off for bad customer service that you can tell are just hyping you and contradicting themselves. and another off for a users manual that contradicts what in the box and what isn't. Good luck with the 2 year warranty. I can already hear the excuses with the two phone calls I had with them. (had to search the internet for their phone number) and for the contradicting emails I received when making inquiries as to why some units come with a filter and other do not and which is the newer unit. One star off for bad customer support. That's a biggie with me, ."
661,Love it,"I love these humidifiers, literally my top choice of all that I¡¯ve bought over the last ten years. Quiet, easy to clean, and the Bluetooth function is great"
662,easy to use,easy to use very quiet
663,Soundless!!!,"It was soo easy.  Easy to follow directions and ready to use, even the app was easy to download.  Then when I turned it on I was shocked.  It makes no sound!  The first night made a difference.  No muss, no fuss!  Fantastic product!"
664,BEST HUMIDIFIER,"I LOVED this humidifier. It was quite and so easy to clean. It had so many great features unfortunately the one feature I needed was missing. I live in an extremely dry area, and I could not set the desired humidity level I needed manually. I do not have a Smartphone and thought I could set this manually."
665,Not what I expected,I bought this for my 2 year old with asthma. I was hoping it would kick on when the humidity got low. I will push the on button and it will say 37% but the machine is not running.
666,Watch the moisture,"Nice and quiet.  Easy to use.  Be careful where you place it.  Started this on the carpeted floor, but it caused the carpet to become wet as the moisture only rises so high.  Currently trying it on a stool to get it higher."
667,Love the automatic setting.,Easy to fill. Quiet and attractive.
668,Could not use the humidifier with out an a computer or cell phone.,Could not use the humidifier with out an a computer or cell phone.
669,I don¡¯t recommend it.,"I don't recommend it, I bought 2 .  All 2, it stays all the time, giving that the tank is empty, when it isn't."
670,Doesn't read humidity correctly or something,Idk what but I think it reads the amount of moisture it shoots out of the top because the machine will read that the rh is at 62 percent but all my rh meters will read a good 20 percent lower then that I'm cranking it to max flow to see if I can get my tent at 60 percent...
671,Unit works exactly as advertised and works well in a fairly large area.,Unit works perfect for Master bedroom and even in the living room.  Have had no issues whatsoever with it.
672,Research before you buy. Must use distilled water and clean weekly.,"I¡¯m not able to stock quantities of distilled water, can¡¯t carry gallon jugs. Also not an engineer, breaking down every part of this humidifier every week to clean is beyond my tolerance."
673,Goog,I like the refill from the top
674,Great smart humidifier,The smart app / open API work great and it handles the entire downstairs well. Very easy to keep full and the light is a nice touch. Levoit seems to make great stuff and I haven't had any issues with it.
675,Game changer in a dry climate,I live in the mountains in a very dry climate. I have had issues with breathing - especially at night. This machine is quiet and produces a light and constant mist which now allows me to sleep throughout the night without nose issues. Love this product
676,Works good,"Works good for the room I use it in, just make sure you clean it often. A lot of mold grew fast, but I used a little bleach and it cleaned up nicely.(make sure you rinse well after bleach) I do love the app features, the notifications for when it's low on water is amazing."
677,I now have 4 of these and plan to get more,"We have tried a lot of humidifiers over the years and these are extremely easy to clean, which is a HUGE selling point for us, and add on that they are wifi enabled so that we can check on things and get reminders is extremely helpful. The other great thing is them shutting off when they hit your chosen humidity level."
678,Amazing,I'm old school and use to the big old humidifiers. This humidifier for its size has been amazing! I even purchased another one for my son and he loves it! I would recommend this any day of the week! Great product!
679,Quiet and easy to use,"It is quiet. I love the auto feature that maintains my desired humidity level. I like the notifications via app on my phone to clean my device, refill, etc."
680,I will buy another,This is very easy to clean. Easy to add water. Puts out a good amount of humidity based on the setting. It¡¯s feeding my living area just fine. When my vicks bedroom humidifier goes this will absolutely be the replacement
681,needs filtered or distilled water.,works as expected.
682,Would not stay on,"Constantly shut itself off, with the low water light flashing before shutdown. Would not even stay on for 15 minutes before this happened. The base had water in it, the tank had water in it, and all the troubleshooting steps suggested by support were tried. I had this exact problem with the 200S also. I think they have a problem with their manufacturing or something.

If it weren't for that it would have probably been a great humidifier."
683,Love it,"Easy to clean, easy to fill.  Love this humidifier"
684,Helpful,Sinus problem
685,Great product.,Great product all around. Easy to clean. Easy to fill. Very quite. No complaints
686,Water level error - doesn¡¯t work.,The product malfunctioned right out of the box. I followed all of the setup instructions and I consistently get a water level error. It¡¯s not functioning at all. Evidently this is a known issue. This is definitely disappointing.
687,No noise yet,Works wonderful. Cold steam. Blows a large cloud a good distance. Has a spout so you can direct the flow- doesn¡¯t go straight if there is air flow around it.
688,1st time best rated really was!,"I purchased the humidifier for our master bedroom. I read all the reviews and ¡°10 Best¡± ratings. This was #1. The humidity in our bedroom was 10%. With less than 20 hrs of operation it was up to 35% . Running it on Auto, it went through most of the tank, but now that it runs all day, water usage is less, but you still need to fill daily. Operation is essentially silent. I don¡¯t use the nightlight. All in all, this is a quality item that does exactly what you expect."
689,Leaks badly,"I loved this humidifier when we got it. It is quiet and detects humidity level in room. But one week after, it started leaking. A tray underneath would do nothing it was THAT much water. I had seen other reviews stating this was an issue, and unfortunately yes this product is defective. :("
690,Good!," We¡¯ve had this for a few months now, and it has been doing wonders for our plants, and lungs. App works great, but I have no issues just pressing the buttons.

If you plan on constantly using this, you¡¯ll have to fill/change out the water every 24/48 hours depending on what setting you are using, and how big the room is.

Make sure when you do, you are wiping out the bottom so it doesn¡¯t get a bunch of mildew.

Additionally, it does look like it leaks at the bottom, or that moisture gets trapped underneath after being used for a long period.

This isn¡¯t an issue for us, as we use a stool to move it around the house to an area that needs it. If you plan on keeping in one area, you may want to keep a baking sheet underneath."
691,Exactly as described,Works great
692,Not great at all but good customer service,"This unit is quiet and easy to clean and set up as others have mentioned but it only humidifies about a one square foot area. I even set it on high and left it on all night in the nursery and the changing table next to it was barely damp in the morning. I guess this would be good if you needed to humidify a dollhouse

Updated to add: customer service reached out to me and replaced my unit. I won¡¯t change the original rating but they also gave me some usage tips to optimize the device. We are doing much better. Worth it"
693,has an auto feature,That it is easy to read the humidity levels!
694,"Do not buy! Low output, constant dripping sound, shoddy valve",This is a poorly made device. Very low output even on high. Constant dripping sound. Shoddy valve a weak link. I don¡¯t know who rates this highly.
695,Great humidifier,Works great with the app. Have a schedule and works perfectly
696,Jury still out,"We got out humidifier on Dec 14, 2021. It was great for the first 7-10 days and did exactly what we wanted.  It was so easy to use a raise the humidity in our room.  Now, it shuts off on its own within an hour of starting.  Last week it ran non stop until I turned it off.  I set it at MED and then turn down Auto, but now it turns off.  I read all the manual instructions and I didn¡¯t see anything about this auto shutoff.  So, I¡¯m trying to decide if I really like this unit or not."
697,Amazing!!!,So quiet. Easy to fill and clean. The app works great with it!
698,"Worth the price, works SO well!","All of its bells and whistles are super impressive and work really well for me! The auto sensing feature and Alexa compatibility make it SO convenient. The mist is super quiet and if you put essential oils on the oil pad provided, it works so well¡ªI love that it doubles as a diffuser. Definitely worth the price in my opinion! I also have a Levoit air purifier and have been thoroughly impressed with it as well over the last few years. Seems to be a solid brand!"
699,Bad design,"After owning for a month, i can safely say this thing is garbage. It would be fine if they didnt try to pack it full of sensors and features that do not work and ultimately ruin the whole product.

Every time you refill, its a coin flip that it will come up with an error saying its out of water. Lifing the reservoir off and putting it back down has another coin flip chance of making it work again. The problem is this error will not appear for about 15 minutes after refilling (it works initially) so if you refill right before bed you cant be sure it actually runs overnight and you wake up with a bloody nose half the time.

The other irritating problem ive had is the night mode function that turns off the display. When you put it in night mode it will only run on auto settings which will turn itself off at 40% humidity. The problem here is that the humidity sensor on this reads about 10-15% over what the actual humidity in the room is because the mist just falls around it raising the humidity in the immediate vicinity of the humidifier but nowhere else in the room so the humidity sensor is ultimately useless.

This humidifier is poorly designed with a bunch of sensors and features chucked in to make it look good in an amazon ad but which actually just make the product worse. If it didnt have these features it would be fine."
700,Connected is a plus,Love that this connects to alexa.
701,Ringing in ears!!,My ears are still ringing and it¡¯s been off for over an hour!! It¡¯s 1 in the morning - I am going to unplug it and when I go out today it¡¯s going on the trash!! Pure Garbage!!!
702,It doesn't work at all!!!,"This humidifier doesn't work as it explained at all even from the very first time. We added water to tank as the direction said and every time, we powered it on, the alert sign of ""No water"" showed up and the humidifier powered itself off. It turned out no water goes down from the tank into the base and I have to manually pull up the ""button"" to let water go down, which would either cause water leakage (when too much water goes down), or the humidifier stopped automatically due to no water.

What terrible experience this has been!! We wished to return it but unfortunately the original package was thrown away and now I have to keep this garbage at home!!!"
703,Love it,Great unit and love the app.
704,Smart features do not function well,"I've been using this product for about a month. The features it provides sound good but do not function correctly. The number one issue I have is almost every time I refill the tank, the humidifier stops working and the app tells me the tank is empty. Often, I will pull the tank off and put it back on only to have it stop working in another 30 seconds. This is beyond annoying. The other issue is that the automatic mode relies on a sensor on the unit which is always 15-20% higher humidity than what it actually is in the room. This means automatic mode is essentially useless."
705,This thing has a mind of its own,It keeps telling me the top has been lifted when it hasn't. It says it's empty when it's not. This thing is junk don't buy it
706,Garbage,"Don¡¯t let the high price deceive you, this is a piece of garbage. Filled up with water and seemed fine. Until ten minutes later, it started leaking the entirety of its chamber for no apparent reason. Happened twice and I will be returning it tomorrow."
707,"Full tank of water, ¡°no water¡± symbol pops up",The title of my review sums it up. Disassembled and reassembled twice to make sure it was put together correctly. Still says no water when there¡¯s a full tank
708,Humidifier for bedroom,It is automatic. It will turn off when humidity level is reached. You can down load app to have many more choices for programming.
709,Great Humdifier!,"This humidifier works very well. The mist is ultra fine and does not get your surfaces wet. I love the fact that it can be controlled from my phone, and if it runs out of water before I check it, it shuts off and lets me know that it is empty on my phone. I liked it so good that I have purchased a second one for my upstairs!"
710,BUY IT,This thing is so quite and absolutely is the best humidifier I have purchased through the years. My search stops with Levoit
711,Excellent ultrasonic humidifier,"I liked the first one I bought so much I came back and got a second one. Our apartment was sitting at barely 25-30% RH and the humidifier I was using was doing nothing, even on high. This had decent reviews so I gave it a try. These humidifiers have a great and easy to use smartphone app, and readily integrate with Google home if you desire. With two of these cranking away, I put over 4 gallons a day into the air and we're finally holding steady at a more comfortable 40% RH. It is top filling, with a nice big open water tank unlike many others- no dealing with tiny screw caps on the bottom of the tank. These are very quiet. The auto feature is nice, especially once paired with the smart phone app. You just set your desired humidity on the app and let it do it's thing- all you have to do is make sure the tank stays filled. I am very, very happy with both of them."
712,Easy to fill humidifier,Big open top area for filling.  Water container is clear so you can see what is left.  Works great in the bedroom we put it in.
713,sound and works consistently with tap water although long term is unknown.,Nothing to dislike
714,We named this on ¡°Big Daddy¡±,"We named this one Big Daddy in the VeSync app as he is a portly gentleman of a humidifier. Easy to assemble, large capacity, easy to clean, easy to connect in the app, and superior performance. There is a small brush included for cleaning. There are also a total of 3 aromatherapy pads included to diffuse essential oils in the unit without damaging the unit of having to always smell it. There is a chamber that pops out on the back like a SIM card to swap. This has a nightlight, the ability to turn the display on and off, unlimited moisture settings, and more. I definitely recommend you follow the instructions and use distilled water. I have 3 of these units as I am in Wisconsin and winters can be brutal on our sinuses, skin, and our houseplants. I have multiple other devices from Levoit and cannot recommend them enough!"
715,Completely quiet and easy to use,Have in bedroom and it is completely quiet.Very easy to maintain and clean.
716,Connecting to Alexa is great!,"I think the product works well, has improved the sleeping conditions greatly!"
717,QUIET and works great.,I have had other brands that did not work very well and always broke within 2 years.  I have not had this for 2 years yet but it seems to be a much better unit.  Easy to fill and easy to turn on with app on my phone.  working great!
718,Didn¡¯t work,I tried it in my house noticed it was the same with or without humidifier
719,Works great,"This is very quiet, easy to clean, and I love the different settings.  The auto works best for us. I'm glad I bought two of them!"
720,6L of Water on the Floor,Whoever engineered this product should be fired.  The water flow design requires precision component placement I wouldn¡¯t expect at this price point (and definitely didn¡¯t receive).  The hammer mechanism bobs in the water and requires contact in the spring loader on the water tank.  The parts offer no margin for error on contact. After 5 minutes of usage I heard a pop (the spring misfiring from the water tank) and the unit leaked all 6L on to the floor.  This should be designed for the price point with a margin of error.
721,Most helpful: easy to refill from top,Best feature is big hole after lifting to cover for refill compared to others need to do from bottom via smaller homes.  Nice to have auto setting that tries to control spraying to reach wanted humidity level.  And Wifi connect and controllable in mobile app is helpful.
722,"Like the other Levoit I had, it's very good while it works","Like the title says, I had another Levoit humidifier that lasted 3 or 4 winters. This winter when I tried to get it working again, it wouldn't even power up. So I decided to get another one. So I bought this one, and like I've mentioned before, it works beautifully, it's quiet, you can turn off the screen, and it's quite powerful and it's enough for our large bedroom. This new Levoit humidifier even has controls through an app on your phone. So it's pretty cool. Let's see how long this lasts before it breaks down."
723,I like it.,"Does what it says, has not leaked, is quiet, responds quickly to commands. It has helped me sleep."
724,Junk,"Right out of the box, the tasnk didn't just leak, water ran out of the tank faster than I could clean it up.  Of course, it was MADE IN CHINA!  Opened the box, read the book, set it up, filled it up and the water ran out the bottom of the tank on to the table and the floor.  Packed it up.  Sent it back.  Last two purchases from Amazon were Chinese made.  Both failed.  Reminds me of toys I had as a kid post WWII.  MADE IN JAPAN.  They were crude and were also junk.  Sick of CHINESE MADE PRODUCTS."
725,Silent and works well for smaller rooms!,I use this for my guitar room for when it gets dry.  It is virtually silent and works as expected.  App is easy to use and I keep it on auto.  It turns on when needed and off when it¡¯s done.  It¡¯s easy to fill and I have no complaints.
726,Controls and himidity monitor are bad,Humidity readings are grossly inaccurate and useless. Controls are finicky amd keep resetting by themselvs. All in all a useless piece of junk.
727,Reports Empty,"Does a great job for humidity, however may run for hours then Stop and report ""Out of Water"". Night light doesn't function. Maybe I just got a bad one."
728,A Great Humidifier,"My bedroom becomes an arid desert in the winter and leaves my mouth, nose, and eyes utterly dry. Other humidifiers have a small capacity and need to be refilled each night. This one holds 6 liters and I fill it every 3rd night. Its electronic controls on density and speed are superb. (Just don't put water down into the mist spout or you have to empty the machine to get it to work - but the manufacturer warns you about this.) Most Highly Recommended."
729,READ THIS BEFORE ORDERING:  It only works with phone app - Useless toy.,"I ordered this Levoit humidifier because it was recommended by some online household magazines.  But it is a useless toy.  It only works with a phone app, so it is a product devised for people who keep their smart phone with them at all times, even at home.  The ""buttons"" (it has no proper buttons) do not work:  one can press the on/off button for ever, and the screen turns on for a millisecond to then turns off again.  Everything about it has the stench of a poorly made Chinese toy.  The plastic is dismal (fragile, brittle).  The cord is very short.  The base weighs less than a feather, so it is very easy to accidentally tip.  This is just a bad joke and a waste of money, rather than a properly made small appliance.  One must assume that the company ""harvests"" all those reviews by providing free samples or other incentives.  Do not buy this dismal toy."
730,Best humidifier yet,I bought this humidifier for our bedroom which gets very dry during the winter months. Over the years I¡¯ve had at least two or three humidifiers that I¡¯ve done an adequate job but I was looking for something better. According to my wife this is the best she does not wake up to a stuffy nose any longer. I enjoy the fact that I can that I can set a timer and turn it on and off with Wi-Fi. I¡¯ve only had it less than a week but so far it is exceeding my expectations.
731,"Great item, excellent vendor!",I bought one of these last year and had a problem with intermittent leaking. Communicated with the seller and they just sent me a new one! That's great customer service.
732,No manual ON button,"I paid double what I would normally pay for a humidifier because I wanted one that I knew would work well with essential oils.  Yes, I saw that it had smart capabilities, but that wasn't important to me.  What I didn't know and never dreamed is that this unit has no manual ON button.  You are required to download the app and sync with the unit before you can even turn it on.  The last thing you want to do when you are sick is jump through hoops.  The app might be nice for some people, but for me it was far too much to deal with when I was so sick I couldn't get up.  Smart capabilites should never be the only option.  A simple ON button is a basic function every mechanical device should have.  If I had saved the box, I'd have sent this one back for a simple machine.  Other than that, the unit makes absolutey no noise when functioning and being able to set the humidity level is also nice."
733,Can¡¯t use oils with this,Nice humidifier but the Amazon description indicates you can use it w oils however the product handbooks contradicts this entirelyÿ That was my purpose in buying it.
734,Thing isn't built right,"I have several Levoit air filters, thought this would be the same quality. Not even close. Reservoir dumped out all contentts on the carpet in less than an hour. Leaked all over. So mad."
735,Need yfi to use this product,"Water amount is good,  but  trying to make it work was a challenge"
736,Use distilled water for best results,"The bottom turned red fairly quickly. Within a week the red, smily film was noticeable and also gray floaties. The parts that need cleaning are odd shaped so it was hard to submerge entirely in vinegar without using almost half the jug. The creases are also hard to clean and wish these parts came apart more so that the red smile could be removed more easily before putting it back to use for my newborn. Switched to distilled water vs filtered water and the red smile was noticeably less but still recommended that it¡¯s cleaned weekly"
737,Okay,"Quiet, has a large tank, keeps disconnecting from the app. Have to reset it every few days or every week. Does not stay connected to the app for long. Sometimes will turn on and off on its own even when not in auto."
738,Horrible,"1. Automatically turns on even when it is turned off. No schedules setup to wake it.
2. Changes automatically from manual mode to auto mode.
3. In auto mode the humidistat keeps climbing  up beyond 70. 1 unit per 2 secs. And stays there. Even though the room is at 35-40."
739,Happy humidity,I'm sure it's the best Humidifier I've ever purchased and has may be most happy.
740,Dusty,Very quiet and efficient. It leaves a white powdery substance on furniture around it.  It does clean off easily but hoping it¡¯s because it¡¯s new.
741,Automatic humidity function,I like the automatic humidity function.  It adjusts to what is the right amount of humidity in our home.  It is SO easy to fill and clean.
742,"Quiet, high capacity and remote control works nice","Living in Arizona we need humidity especially when sleeping in the ""winter"".  Bought this for the ratings and capacity... and top filling feature.  We have a high ceiling so needed the extra capacity.  Holds about 1.5 gal of water.

VERY quiet.  Love it"
743,Fair,The humidifier feature for this is fantastic. If you want the added feature of being able to use oils I would not recommend this unit. It requires a lot with the amount of water and it does NOT distribute well.
744,Great humidifier,"I absolutely love this humidifier. I was hesitant since it¡¯s a little more than what I was looking to spend, but I¡¯m so glad I splurged. The ease of use alone is worth every penny. Having the top-fill is a relief, making it easy to keep full and to clean. All the settings are great and I find the app to be very user friendly and helpful. I particularly enjoy how it has smart scenes where it can turn off or on automatically based on the humidity level. So far, this is the quietest humidifier I have encountered."
745,Maintains set humidity,"Bought a cheaper Levoit - wouldn't get the humidity up to 50% in a couple days. Small room. This one does the job, and shuts on and off auto as needed - saving trouble, and water."
746,"Quiet and effective, but hard to clean and humidistat is VERY inaccurate.","Quiet and put out a lot of humidity. But the humidistat was always inaccurate and varied a lot. It waa normally 20 percent higher than my acccurate meter. This made the wifi features and the auto on/off pretty much useless. Also, it was hard to clean and got pink mold marks at the onr week mark even using distilled water. While thats bound to happen, with so many creases and crevasses it was impossible to completly clean even with soaking with vinegar according to manual and using the included brush."
747,Not able to add the humidifier to the VeSync app,"The app is not able to connect my humidifier to the WiFi, and as a result I am not able to use the app to control the humidifier. No one has responded to my support for two weeks now. Very disappointed"
748,Multiple defective units,"The first unit I received shut itself off after a minute or so because the indicator said the water tank was empty even though it was full. I exchanged it for another unit. That unit worked well for 5 days and then I got the same ¡°out of water¡± error. I see a number of questions about this problem in the Q&A section, so it seems to be a broader issue."
749,Great product!,Easy to clean and silent when in use
750,Better in my opinion than the warm mist by Levoit,I love the Bluetooth. Wish your more expensive warm mist dehumidifier had Bluetooth :(  I got one of each and love the top fill on this unit and love that I can easily control humidity in my indoor veggie garden.
751,"Wow, impressed me for a humidifier.","Easy to setup and powerful .
Connects easy to Google home assistant,  voice commands work well."
752,Quiet,"I'm a very light sleeper and this humidifier is so quiet and doesn't wake me up.  It was Wire Cutter's  #1 choice, so I went for it and glad I did.  I don't use the Smart features, so can't rate that but it's worth every penny to not have to endure a noisy or brightly lit humidifier."
753,Love it,"Finally, the humidifier that I like!
So ready-out-of-the-box and use. Great remote control.
Easy to clean. Super happy with my purchase."
754,It really is silent!,This humidifier really is silent! A gallon of water lasts a long time. The auto setting really works. I'd recommend this to anyone who needs a humidifer.
755,The last humidifier you will ever need to buy!,"LOVE everything about this humidifier! I have gone through so many humidifiers, and this one is IT! Easy to clean, large capacity, WiFi app enabled, smart- it is the whole package! You won¡¯t regret this purchase!"
756,Breathing easier,Very good product
757,Love it,"I have had many humidifiers for my plant babies and non of them have worked as well as this one. I still haven¡¯t figured out a good cleaning method but there is no sound at all, the small light is not to bright and the settings are very easy to manage. I highly recommend trying this one!"
758,"Nice item, one problem","Well-designed, compact, elegant, easy to use, this seems like a quality item. However, it is somewhat lacking in power. Even at the high setting, the (very silent) fan does not project the mist very far, or at much volume. The humidifier struggles to maintain 50% humidity in a 150 square foot bedroom during a dry winter night. Have not used the WiFi option with the app yet."
759,Spectacular!!,"Took a shot on this machine based on the reviews but wasn't stoked about the price. I ended up eating my words. I have now purchased a second machine for our house and recommended to my mother for her house. I couldn't recommend this more. It is super easy to clean, reminds you about the weekly clean, allows for changing the humidity as needed, and I love filling it from the top as opposed to from the bottom."
760,Didn¡¯t work!,I just received this today and it won¡¯t even turn on! And it leaked all over my carpet while I was trying to figure out how to get it to turn on! What a piece of garbage! Returning immediately :(
761,App control is great,"Pros: water fill on the top of the unit; app control; auto shutoff when water is low;
Cons: none"
762,Recommended use with purified or distilled water,"The good: very silent; produces solid mist; tank will last 24+ hrs on highest setting

The bad: the manufacturer recommends that the humidifier be used with either purified or distilled water. Hmmm? Not sure what they mean with ""purified"" (there are different levels of purification), but distilled? Seriously? What is the practicality of using a humidifier with distilled water? Is the user supposed to buy distilled water for everyday use? Or distill water at home, presumably using a specialized equipment?

Another minor point. The humidity setting feature is useless. The sensor is obviously located in the base of the device, so the humidifier measures humidity at the base of the device, where most of the mist is concentrated. In my case, if I measure humidity at the other end of the room, the measurement is 20-30% lower than the device shows."
763,Leaked everywhere,"Too disgusted for words.  Just opened it up, read directions, took all the packaging out , filled it up and now I am using three bathtowels to soak up the water out of the carpet the warranty means NOTHING to me right now.  I am not interested in a replacement, will just be expecting a refund."
764,Works like a charm,"Put this to work as soon as we got it! Very easy to use, very quiet and sleep mode lets you sleep without any lights. Takes about 5 minutes to get our room to an appropriate humidity level for a good nights sleep."
765,Great so far!,"I have had very poor luck with cool mist humidifiers in the past, and typically stick to warm ones. Due to the supply chain issues of late 2021, I have fewer options. This machine has ran well thus far. It makes very little noise and puts out a lot of moisture on the highest setting. The ¡®spout¡¯ is adjustable, so you can aim it in whichever direction you like without moving the entire machine.

Very sturdy. Very easy to fill, use, and clean. Best cool mist humidifier I¡¯ve tried."
766,Quiet and efficient,"You get a lot of value for the price with the Levoit 300S humidifier. It is lightweight and creates an adjustable variable mist. It is controlable either manually or via an Ap you can download into your phone. If you use manual operation, just lightly touch the on/off button,don't try to overpower it.
When you are finished humidifying one room. Shut it off and move it into next."
767,A Must Have,"Bought 1st one, and I am loving it, very quiet, great misting , room is very comfortable and cool and not dry . Not suffering now with dry air and i wake up coughing.  Def a must buy, easy to set up, love the app control."
768,Great device for what I need (treating a sinus infection),"I love this.  It looks good.  Easy to use.  As for complaints about the auto feature, I never use that so it hasn¡¯t been an issue for me.  I use it on low, medium, or high always and just let it run.  I have a built in filtration system in my kitchen and use that for the water, instead of the tap, so no issues there.

I tend to use humidifiers for sinus infections - I¡¯m not using this thing every day of the winter, so my review is limited to week or so long stints of use.  For that purpose, this thing is great.  It¡¯s the only reason I am sleeping at all.  When you have a sinus infection, at night you¡¯re dry and scratchy, and at your worst.  This thing lets out a pretty strong, heavy plume of mist into the air, even on low and medium.  I love it.  If you¡¯re like me and buying this for a cold, can¡¯t recommend enough!"
769,"So far, it¡¯s great",So far it¡¯s great - super duper quiet and very fine mist. Tank is a monster - takes forever to fill and states ¡®purified water¡¯  - we¡¯ll see how it cleans once our hard water leaves calcium.
770,Great product!,"Works really well! Quiet, easy to fill, easy to clean. First one worked so well I bought a second one."
771,Onboard humidity meter isn't reliable,"The unit is well built and functions correctly, but in auto mode the onboard hygrometer it uses to decide when to turn on/off isn't very reliable. For the first month or so it was fine (within about 5 percentage points of my 2 external hygrometers) but after that it went downhill and got to the point where it was 20 percentage points off of what the other 2 agreed on. That made auto mode borderline useless at that point."
772,Whisper quiet; no wet floors,"This has really made breathing in the house better.  Our great room is a large, wide-open, high ceiling room, open to the kitchen, dining room and entryway.  We get the full benefit of the humidifier in those areas.  Right now we are carrying it down the hall to the bedroom for nighttime.  We should just get a second one.  It really conserves on water.  It senses humidity and will shut on and off without making a noise.  You can see exactly what the humidity is on the lighted dial on the front.  You can turn the light off at night to keep your room dark.  We love that it's top-load with no filter.  We just use the buttons to run it.  If you're tech-smart, you can run it from other sources.  It's light enough to carry from place to place.  This has made sleeping so much more breathable.  Less runny or stuffy noses.  Our skin isn't as dry and shriveled either.  Five Stars.  We put a towel down for the first 5 nights and days.  It never wets the towel, so we put the towel away.  We don't hear any dripping either inside the machine."
773,Excellent purchase!,"This thing was intimidating out of the box. I was not expecting it to be so big, but its an excellent humidifier! super simple and easy to operate from the app. It is set up in my kids room and I can see the status, and change settings without ever disrupting them at night. we have gone through several humidifiers from companies like Vicks, safety first, and a few others that were a pain from the moment we opened the box. Not this one though. I am eager to see how well it holds up over time. the tank has a huge fill opening and handles to carry it back and forth. Its also nice you don't have to flip it upside down to fill it. I was very concerned about not being familiar with this brand, but they've won me over."
774,Light indicating quality of filter has a battery that is not replaceable,Since the light indicating the quality of the filter has a battery that is irreplaceable which renders this function unavailable eventually and then the user has to decide the ability of the filter to truly provide clean water
775,Awful humidifier!,"Likes:
Large tank
Very quiet
Humidity gauge

Dislikes:
Filter turned orange after 1 use
Manu. doesn¡¯t offer replacement filter
Leaks
Arrived dirty"
776,"Hard to clean, doesn¡¯t raise my humidity",I have a 200 SF living room and I keep this running 24/7 and I can¡¯t get my humidity levels over 25%. It¡¯s also hard to clean and seems to need a full cleaning every other day. It¡¯s quiet and sleek looking though.
777,Poor quality.  Low vapor and shuts off and leaks everywhere,"This model keeps turning off when it is set on 'High' mode.  On this mode, it should run until the water tank is empty.  The water tank is full, its set up correctly, and still keeps shutting off.  Upon initial setup, it worked well for the first 2 hours.  Now, it shuts off after 10 minutes and even on 'High'.

Update: I have had this for less than 12 hours.  The above text is my initial review.  Since then, it has leaked water everywhere. It's either possessed, or one of the worst humidifiers I have ever seen."
778,Works exactly as I hoped,"I needed a humidifier that would allow a large room to get some moisture, this has an auto setting that seems to work perfectly for my needs."
779,Using distilled water is the smart way,Very  quiet. No cleaning involved if only distilled water is used. Easy to control via cell phone.
780,Very nice machine,It is quiet and works much better than cheaper humidifiers.
781,Out of water when tank is full,"Tanks is full and reservoir is empty, spring not engaging, seems a critical piece to function, bricked.  Do not buy unless you have time to fix spring / float engaging mechanism."
782,Advertised 2nd year warranty looks to be a scam,Works ok though frequently powering off for no apparent reason.  Product comes with a mailer which advertises an extra year of warranty when product registered.  Did all that was required but no indication warranty extended.  Zero response to all emails sent.
783,POS,Leaking between the tank.and the base unit. This was my 2nd try on this item but same problem with the 1st one.
784,Really puts out a lot of vapor.,I run a cabinet shop. In the winter months you have to add humidity to keep the lumber from cracking. This item works great. It uses a gallon a day. Highly recommend for rooms that are too dry.
785,Amazon is becoming a big scam,"Wow best seller and tons of 5 star reviews. Until you read the reviews and they are all bad!  How does Amazon calculate their averages?  Anyway, connected product to app several times with limited success. Thing just shuts off and app won¡¯t remember it. I¡¯m a very tech savvy person and this just isn¡¯t right. Don¡¯t recommend.  I¡¯m returning this."
786,Great product and perfect for my room.,Using for a while now still works great. Love it. Definitely recommend it to everyone
787,Amazing,"How can a humidifier be this neat? I have no idea, everyone calls me crazy when I go on about how much I love my new humidifier. Seriously though, this thing is awesome. Know that obnoxious bubble sound most humidifiers make every few minutes when getting more water into the base from the reservoir? This thing has none, not pretty much none, not very soft, absolutely NONE! My dogs used to bark in the middle of the night every time my old one made the bubble sound, they haven't woke up once from this one.
I can control everything from my phone, I don't have to touch this thing except to fill it and clean it. Speaking of cleaning it, the awesome app sends you a notification every week reminding you to clean it. Love the auto function that turns it off automatically when it hits the set room humidity. It makes the tank last days, but even when I let it run all night I still have tons of water left over in the morning. Love that it gives off no light when the night light is turned off, and the night light setting gives off a super soft light. Love I have the option to add essential oils using the insert for scents. Assembly was super easy, and the app is very user friendly. It even gives you an alert when it runs out of water and it turns itself all the way off.

I can't say I have a single had thing to say about this thing. It's awesome!"
788,this humidifier is my arch enemy,"This humidifier is too smart for anyone¡¯s good. Without fail, every time after I refill the empty tank, the humidifier displays an error message that says ¡°please add water¡± and it auto shuts off.

you can imagine how frustrating it is for your humidifier to automatically shut off when it *thinks* it needs water, but the tank is actually full.  this error will sometimes cause the humidifier to shut off in the middle of the night, and then I wake up with dry eyeballs.

I went through all of the troubleshooting to make this error stop. but the best I can do to make the error go away (and make the humidifier run) is to lift up the water tank and just jiggle some random parts around and hope that works.

the company was great about my issues. but this failure to run (the ONE job the humidifier has) makes this utter crap.

you¡¯re better off with a simple CVS humidifier."
789,Great buy,"This was a great purchase. It¡¯s very quiet, produces a great deal of steam and works efficiently and effectively."
790,So good I bought another one,"I live in Colorado, and for me a humidifier is essential. This one is quiet and has a large capacity tank that is easy to fill. I bought one for my bedroom, and I liked it so much I bought another one for the living room (or the guest room when occupied.) It makes my skin feel less dry, and I love that I can use Alexa to turn it on and off. It's also easy to clean, and I appreciate the automated reminders to do that."
791,Haven¡¯t tried sleep mode,I love how easy it is to fill and how it works.  I also love being able to add essential oils.  I find it a real challenge to clean.  Either I¡¯m not doing something right or it is just a bear by design.
792,DO NOT BUY,I¡¯ve had nothing but problems with it since I purchased it. The sensor keeps saying its out of water (it¡¯s full) and automatically shuts it off. So it runs for about 5 min then shuts off. Yes I looked at the troubleshooting page. Messed with the low water float and nothing. Even went online to try to find out some other resolutions only to find that a lot of people have experienced the same problem with the same model. Do yourself a favor. Buy a simple humidifier. The more bells and whistle means only one thing. More problems to go wrong.
793,Doesn¡¯t really do what I need,I added a switch to automatically shut off and on and it hasn¡¯t met my expectation the level of humidity has not been consistent the way I need
794,Easy clean humidifier,"If you are looking for a humidifier which you could clean without taking extraordinary measures (special brushes, etc.), this is it.  It comes apart, you can get you hand in the tank.  It¡¯s great.  With the added bonus of bluetooth phone control it makes it the perfect humidifier."
795,Worst humidifier,Worked for 2 days then started popping the message as water tank is empty even though tank is full. Leaking the water like flowing from water tap. Not satisfied with the product. I will not recommend this product to any.
796,Perfect!,Zero noise.  Works like I imagined and has already improved the dryness of winter in our living area. I am very pleased
797,Very quiet and works great. Love it,Extremely quiet and very easy to set up. Works great
798,Dissapointing,Few weeks old and the AUTO function is not working the computer shuts off and its not properly reading the humidity in the house.......literally brand new..
799,Hard to Clean,"I really hate this humidifier, it is so hard to clean with all the little hidden areas that¡¯s hard to reach."
800,Very Quiet,I have had several room humidifiers and this is the best by far. It very effectively ads humidity to the room and is very quiet. I have not yet cleaned the unit so am unable to comment on that. So far I highly recommend.
801,Love the auto mode,"Very quiet humidifier. I leave it on low all day and night in my bedroom and I only need to refill it once every day and a half. I've only used the diffuser a few times so far and I'm not sure it spreads the scent very well.
Overall it definitely makes a difference in keeping my room at a comfortable humidity level."
802,Value and Quality,"I was surprised to find that cool mist are better for your sinuses than steam vaporizers.  That said this is easy to use and works well in the bedroom, is silent and has a night mode if the lights bug you"
803,Great Humidifier,I love that it tells you the percentage of moisture in the room where you put it.  Very happy with it!
804,Outstanding Humidifier,"Great Humidifier, keeps my apartment (525sq) at 40% humidity with ease. I fill unit with distilled water, and it lasts approximately 60hrs running continuously.
The app is great, and alexa compatibility is great.
Would recommend"
805,Works perfect!,I bought this for our MOTORHOME. It works perfect. Dispenses just enough moisture.
806,Impossible to clean.,"I've been cleaning this thing every Saturday with a steam cleaner. I never paid much attention to the cylinder where the humidified air pours out though. Today while cleaning I took a q-tip to the top part of it and this gunk came out. I used probably about a dozen qtips and they all gathered gunk like this. It's not possible to clean the entire cylinder because it's closed off on both ends so gunk just gathers in there and gets into the air. You breathe this stuff in.

I'm tossing it out, no one should own these things as you can't clean them properly and gunk collects in the most essential part of the humidifier.

Also I use only filtered water to fill this thing. So any owners who have this unit, check that cylinder with a q-tip to see what kind of gunk you're breathing in....

Nasty piece of junk"
807,Finally found the perfect one,"I absolutely love this humidifier!! It is super quiet, has a huge tank, easy to clean and works perfectly with the app. I love I can set timers and humidity level for my bedroom. It will turn on and off the mist with auto mode and you can turn off the display at night too. I was hesitant on the price but I am so happy I went for it."
808,My tank leaks right out of the box.,Tank leaks out of the box.
809,water leaking," water leaking, no aromatherapy"
810,humidifier works good,"So far it works fine, easy to fill, is quiet, haven't cleaned it yet as haven't needed it every day."
811,Perfect for my grow room,We grow plants year round and this provides the perfect humidity control for our herbs and vegetables.  All I do is fill it up and i control everything from my phone.  I set the humidity and it stays within 5% of that.
812,Super easy to use with Alexa,"I LOVE this. If you¡¯re looking for something easy, inexpensive, and smart. This is it..  it¡¯s amazingly easy to use and quite pretty to look at. It¡¯s great for my plants (calatheas). They have shown great improvement since purchasing this. 1000% recommend!"
813,Barley raises the humidity Level after using for hours,"I set this up next to my Vicks unit and turned it on.  I watched my humidity gage barely move.  This does put out a lot of mist, but the mist is mostly air.  Doesn't really add much humidity to the air.  I recommend checking the effectiveness of this with a gage.  If you do, you won't be so impressed by it's large tank."
814,A nice unit for my Grow Tent,"I've been using this humidifier in a grow-tent and can definitely recommend it for at purpose. The ability to add water from the top - without having to carry around the tank - is awesome, but that's not the main reason I like it. The water capacity is perfect for the tent and it adds humidity just as needed.

The WiFi connection and IOS app are great, when it works. The humidifier keeps losing the WiFi connection - and it's not that far from the access point (although there is a wall between the access point and the device."
815,Impossible to clean,"At first I really liked this humidifier- it¡¯s quiet, has a large capacity, is easy to connect to wifi, butÿthen I changed the water and tried to clean it. It¡¯s impossible to clean well. I spent over an hour trying to get down into the crevices where I could visibly see build up and finally gave up. I¡¯m now looking for another humidifier."
816,Quietest humidifier ever!,The humidifier is SUPER quiet which was a big concern when purchasing. It synced easily with my Alexa and intuitively turns on and off based on the moisture in the air. It can also be programmed to go on and off. Has really helped with congestion from the wickedly dry heat in my old house with baseboards!
817,Excellent and very quiet.,"Exactly as described and perfect for the bedroom and my office (or any room) but those rooms were my reason for purchase. The night setting means there¡¯s no annoying light to disturb your sleep, it¡¯s truly whisper quiet and the smart feature is an added bonus. Highly recommend."
818,Love it! Keeps enough moisture in my room and I feel better when I wake up.,It¡¯s very quiet and easy to clean.
819,Harder to clean and doesn¡¯t hold as much as you think.,"Dislike the amount it holds, advertises as holding an entire nights worth and that¡¯s barely true, also harder to clean than I would prefer. Other than that it works amazingly"
820,"Kept stopping, asked to fill an already full tank","The unit looks very nice, top-loading, very good. But frequent stops like every 15-20 minutes are not so good. It kept sending messages to my phone via its app warning me to fill the tank when the tank was two-thirds full. It kept stopping in auto or manual mode after about 15-20 minutes. Finally, I gave up, packed it, and took the package to the local UPS Store. I really wished it worked better. Oh, well. the WireCutter review may need to be updated. I purchased it based on the recommendation by them. The search continues."
821,Great product so far,I love how quiet it is. I like the buttons and the different levels it will pump out the air.  It's a large one I keep in my living room area. Works great for us.
822,SET IT & FORGET IT,"This smart humidifier is amazing! I love that I can set a target humidity level and the humidifier will control itself. The humidity sensor appears to be fairly accurate, which I am sure depends on proper product placement/set up. I have not experienced cleaning this unit yet, but from the videos and product reviews it appears to be relatively easy to clean. No leaks, no fuss, and it¡¯s decent looking! I highly recommend during the drier seasons."
823,Quiet and powerful for its size,I bought this based on a Wirecutter review.  It is the best humidifier I've ever owned.  Pricey but worth it.
824,Would be it again,I love the product
825,Great features for a humidifier,"This humidifier works great. It is easy to set up. Unboxing to running was about 5 minutes and only because of the app. It's Bluetooth and works with Alexa.  It's a top fill model with a wide opening for filling and cleaning.  The app was a breeze to download and connect with Alexa.  I read a few reviews about the app before buying n g that were negative but I didn't think it was that bad at all. The unit has a control panel on the front if you want, the app can control the unit as well as Akexa. The night mode is awesome, completely turns off the light. You can control the humidity level and it has a measure you can see if you want either on the display, in the app, or verbally through Alexa.  I waited for about a month of use to write this review to see how it performed. I highly recommend this unit. No issues at all so far. It does recommend you use distilled water and I do for the most part but have used tap water a few times. The app even reminds you to clean the unit which is easy with the top fill. The actual whole top just lifts off for filling and cleaning.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase"
826,Works perfectly! Considering buying another one for a bedroom,100% what we were looking for
827,This is the most perfect humidifier I can imagine.,"This humidifier is easy to use and clean.  It is so quiet I have to look at it to see if it's on.  It produces cool moisture instantly when you turn it on.  I like that I can turn it on and off with my cell phone.  Last year, when the heat came on starting in October, I got a bloody nose every night.  No bloody nose yet, and it's deep December."
828,Keeps Getting Dirty No Matter How Many Times Cleaned,I ordered this only a few weeks ago and we have continuously cleaned this item yet it keeps getting really gross and dirty in the base. I was complaining of mucus buildup and wheezing in my lungs and now I finally know why! Once I stopped using this at night my lungs went back to normal. Our water quality was recently tested as well (unrelated to this) and that is not the issue. I am surprised at how dirty and disgusting this gets so quickly with minimal use.
829,Excellent Humidifier!,"Received this unit about 2 weeks ago but didn't set it up until a week after that. I don't like the VySync app and turned it off but it still works as expected. It's  quiet  ( don't hear a thing and I'm a light sleeper), very easy to clean and I use distilled water so I don't get any ""white powder' on my furniture as other reviewers have stated. It fills from the top which is a feature that I really like!.  Levoit customer service  is excellent! I would highly recommend this humidifier. (ps) I own a Levoit air purifier which works great too!"
830,THIS is the humidifier you¡¯ve been looking for,"We live in Colorado and this winter has already been dryer than a popcorn fart. This humidifier has been great so far. It¡¯s easy to clean, it¡¯s quiet and boy howdy can it pump out some humidity. I have it set up in our master bedroom. It feels like the perfect size for our room. I fill it up every night and set it on high. I would say on high it lasts about 14-15 hours continuously running. It¡¯s a little pricey but it seems worth it so far. Having square sinks makes it easy to fill as well."
831,Works as expected.,Great misting humidifier. Oil tray was a nice bonus. Haven¡¯t cleaned it yet so that is why I gave two stars but will update later. I recommend.
832,Work well.,Work well.
833,It's nice and quiet but 5% should be 5%,"I personally feel comfortable at 30-35% humidity. I really like this humidifier except for 2 things.
1. If I set the humidity to 30% on auto, it will continue to 40% and beyond. It says it will stop when it reaches 5% over, but it doesn't.
2. When on a schedule, it always turns on in auto mode, which means it will be up to and over 40% which I find too much. I have to change it to manual every day.
Since I have Alexa, it's a verbal switch..but it's the point of the matter. I shouldn't have to."
834,Works Great,"Received today and was easy to set up for manual use.  I don't  plan to bother with the WiFi. Very, very quiet AND the best part, my symptoms have already improved dramatically. Why only 4 stars? I only read the cleaning instructions and it gave me a headache. Must be cleaned weekly and requires lots of white vinegar. There is no such thing as an easy to clean humidifier!"
835,ULTRASONIC HUMIDIFIERS REQUIRES DISTILLED WATER OR YOUR HEALTH IS AT RISK,"This product, like all ultrasonic humidifiers, depend on distilled water in order to emit mist with minimal particulate.
If you do not use distilled water, you are risking health consequences.
Levoit, and sadly, other manufacturers jumping on the ultrasonic bandwagon, ¡°recommend¡± distilled water, but they don¡¯t use strong enough language to compel anybody. After all, why would they want to lose market share to filter dependent competitors?
The problem is, humidifiers are, by nature, not only breeding grounds for bacteria, they can actually make your air worse without steady vigilance. There¡¯s no free ride in this product category for added costs. You have to buy and change filters regularly, or you have to buy distilled water. Pick your poison."
836,Great humidifier!,"Love this humidifier, best part is the app"
837,It's Smart,The only thing I would change is the spout  where the mist comes out. It would be nice to be able to adjust it up or down.
838,Super quiet and easy to use,This thing is super quiet almost no noise at all even other them maybe a random bubble in the tank. The app is easy and works nicely. I control it through the app and i can check it when I'm not home. Top fill is great too! No leaks at all. Nothing bad to say about it.
839,Smart efficient humidifier,Works as intended. My apartment is old and therefore has old heating radiators which dry out the air. This helps me tremendously breathe better at night and get better sleep. Also nice that it can connect via my google home. Has a slot for essential oils too.
840,Notifications are wrong,"Constantly getting the message that the tank is empty when it is not, it is also not over the max line. I have to lift the tank and place it back down so it keeps working. Defeats the purpose of controlling it remotely."
841,Good product.,"Good smart product, good app control.
Option for scheduled on/off is a big plus.
Large easy to fill tank .

No adjustment for desired humidity control (hence the missing star)

Would recommend buying it."
842,Excellent Humidifier,"I've looked at several humidifiers, compared different types of humidifier, finally settled on this one. The app makes it very easy to use. It lets you know the humidity in the room and can keep it whatever target that you set.  With any mist humidifier, using distilled water will help keep the white dust down, especially if you live in an area with hard water. cleaning is not the easier thing in the world, but I haven't really found a humidifier that makes it easy.  Instruction says to use vinegar to soak and get ride of the scale weekly. Haven't had too much trouble with it yet. Overall, I've really liked my purchase and will report back if anything changes."
843,Humidistat seems wonky,"Edited to add: I downloaded the app, and there are more custom settings and control options, which seem to be working great so far. I bumped this up to 4 stars but we will see if the inaccurate humidistat, while off, continues to cause issues

I bought this mainly for the humidistat and auto features. But when it is set to auto, it seems to read the humidity as way higher than it is, so then it never turns on. For example, I had it on auto all night. It read 66% humidity, so it didn¡¯t run since it doesn¡¯t turn on past 50%. I know it¡¯s not actually 66, so I turned it on the medium setting. Within 2 minutes of running, the sensor dropped to 43% and has been hovering around that mark for about 10 minutes now. I like being able to fill it from the top, but may have to return it if the humidistat doesn¡¯t work"
844,High pitch noise,"There is a high pitch noise when the mist level is low, the noise only stops when the mist level is high."
845,Love that I can control it with my phone,"I use this for my plants, they seem very happy with the humidity levels and it¡¯s great to control from my phone so I don¡¯t have to ask my husband to monitor it while I¡¯m away"
846,Good product,It's good to use for a room or smaller room I couldnt get the wifi to connect to my phone don't no why but other then that works like it's suppose to .
847,Not easy to understand how it works--returned it.,"Turn it on. Nothing. Five minutes later, maybe it turns on. It's always a toss up. Did like the top filling tank."
848,Not if you have a gas stove,After two days the flame on our gas stove and gas log in the fireplace turned totally orange instead of blue like it¡¯s supposed to be. Fortunately we found the answer on google before calling a repairman. What¡¯s the answer?  Quit using it and go to an evaporative type humidifier. Then give it to someone who has electric appliances.
849,LEAKED,Had this humidifier for about a week. I LOVED IT. Until it started leaking out of nowhere... In a place it doesn't even have water. I'm super disappointed.
850,functions better in the other 3 sessions,had to tape over the sensor because humidity around the unit was always in the 60+ range ideal is 55 in the winter time when our lips are cracking and mouths get dry our other unit says 40s. was told to use in manual mode. sleep mode is / auto or lights up the entire room. when it's off it knows the humidity is low. don't buy this for smart home
851,Sent to my daughter she said she loves it,Grandson loves fact that he can control it using Alexa
852,It really works.,"I wondered if this little humidifier would do all three rooms of my apartment. It does. Very quiet, easily set up and connected to the wifi, Alexa, and the control app."
853,Better Sleep,"I like this humidifier better than my previous ones. This is much easier to clean Phil my last one ended up with mold in it hard to clean it so someplace is eventually got moldy this one here you can clean it rinse it outI¡¯ll let you know when it¡¯s time to clean it it gives off a lot of missed I love having a feature where you could add scent such as peppermint, lavender, etc. It lets  you know when it¡¯s time to fill itI love have the app babe to control while I¡¯m in a bit if"
854,Headaches,Super quiet and easy to full. Ever since I've used this humidifier I wake up with a terrible sinus headache. If I don't use it I'm fine. Never had a humidifier give me a headache before. They are supposed to prevent them not cause them. Back to Amazon it goes!
855,Works well...when it isn't leaking,"It leaks. Every time it turns off with water in the tank, it leaks. When it's not leaking, it produces huge amounts of vapor. The room got to 92% humidity on low."
856,Works great.,"Have had no problems until I cleaned it this morning, Put it back together and and Power would not stay on, Simply unplugged it and then worked like a charm"
857,Donna,I know I have brought at least 5 humidifiers. This one is wonderful. Without a doubt best one I have ever brought.
858,"Extremely quite, no leaks, no noise, no wet floors sitting about 2 feet off the floor.","There is absolutely no sound in the room at least with my hearing, so super quite and the mist is more like a fog, no wet floors, no leaking, top fill, excellent for all of that.
No clear way to adjust the set point for automatic so it does not tell humidifier to come on because supposedly the humidity is above the factory default set point.
If it runs during the night, the nostrils are no longer dry and irritating.  It does its job well, but I have to put it in low or medium and leave it on all night.  Water usage is minimal on low, so I refill daily so far about 8 cups.  I turn it off during the day, but use it to sleep by during the night to stop dry nostrils and throat.  It works well for that."
859,Best humidifier I've owned,"100% silent, auto regulates the humidity percentage and good price.  Best humidifier I've bought."
860,"So far so good! Just got it a week ago, but it puts out a lot of moisture .","Very quiet, easy to fill, puts out a lot of moisture."
861,Quiet and works well,Very quiet and constant
862,Great,Love this humidifier!!!
863,"Turns off on its own, heavy mist output","UPDATE: I'm returning this unit. It's just too buggy to even bother with and the mist output is just too heavy even on the lowest setting!

I got this one because it has the built in humidistat, but I've found that when I put it on auto, it puts out just a ridiculous amount of mist. I decided to use the low setting and now I'm finding that it shuts itself off randomly (there's plenty of water and it's not on auto). I'm not sure if I got a buggy one or if it's just a flaw of this model. Another issue I'm finding is that the unit doesn't always respond to buttons being pressed.

One thing I do really love, though, is the top fill and the water capacity of this thing. I'm not sure about the other issues - I may check with the manufacturer."
864,Can¡¯t do without anymore!,"Love it, but keeping it clean if you are using tap water is a commitment. But hey, if the alternative is schlepping distilled water from the store I will take it."
865,Only good for a few months,I had purchased one of these humidifiers earlier in the year. I purchased a second one back in September. The second humidifier worked for a solid month and a half. For the past month now it¡¯s been out of sync. Not cooperating via app. Never wants to go by the wet humidity I set it too. Very disappointed
866,Good product,"It is a nice humidifier, quiet, and easy to control, My throat no longer feels uncomfortable due to dryness. The problem is that it is a bit complicated to set the smart futures. Also, humidity does not look very accurate. But it¡®s still worth."
867,I'm glad I spent a little extra on this one,"The best feature is the top fill.  This puts a lot of water into the air and without that I'd be dealing with taking off and turning over the water container all the time.
I didn't think I cared about the app integration, but that allows you to set it to run on auto which keeps humidity within a range.
My only question is the accuracy of the humidity sensor.  it seems to change much more rapidly than I think the room does, but thats a minor point.
overall this was a good decision"
868,Mist humidifier,Works great easy filled small night light is nice
869,Buttons are impossible to use.,"This is a beautifully quiet humidifier when you can get it to turn on. However, apparently the company doesn't want you to use it manually. In both my original unit and the replacement, I had to press the buttons on the front multiple times...as in press on/off 12 times then get frustrated and walk away, and try again later. All the buttons are like this, not just the power. This is such a serious design flaw that I cannot understand how the product ever made it to market.
After looking at other 1 star reviews, I now see that my experience isn't unique."
870,Great for the bedroom!,This is a great product. It is not loud. I really like the fact that it is app controlled.
871,This thing was perfect for a while,This thing at first was perfect. Now it keeps saying tank is empty. Driving me crazy.
872,Humidity reading still doesn't work.,"Can't get humidity read out fixed. Had tech support help, very nice but unsuccessful. The rest of the humidifier is just fine. See photos. Actual humidity in the room is 54%. Humidifier said it's 90 right now. It does fluctuate but still can't get the correct reading using blu tooth & using their app as instructed by tech support. Nice design doesn't look bad on the counter."
873,Quite good,"The humidifier itself works extremely well, and the large capacity allows me to run it for 24 hours or more without refilling. Unfortunately the VeSync smartphone app for the unit is crap. It keeps losing the connection even though all the Wi-Fi settings are correct. Every two or three days I¡¯ve had the power cycle the unit, delete the app, download it again and reconnect the device. It¡¯s a pain."
874,GREAT HUMIDIFIER,"I am a plant person that always needs a good quality humidifier. I would say this is the best one yet!!  I will be buying another one! The Bluetooth option is wonderful as it reminds you to clean and when it is empty. Cleaning is also easy, parts that are usually difficult to clean on humidifiers the pieces are removable for easy cleaning. 10 out of 10 recommend."
875,Auto shut-off spontaneously turns device off,"Even when I refill the tank, it says no water and won¡¯t run.
I¡¯ve followed all the trouble shooting steps given by support and nothing has worked."
876,It's Okay,"The description didn't say that the ""Auto"" settings could ONLY be adjusted in the ""app""...which annoys me.  I don't want to have to open an ""app"" to adjust my humidifier.
Whatever you set the humidity to, it doesn't come on until it's 5% below that or go off until 5% above.  I should be able to adjust this to what I want.
I would like to be able to control the Humidity AND the mist level independently in auto mode.
It's OKAY...but I probably wouldn't buy it again."
877,So easy to fill!,I like how easy it is to fill. I do wish that the LED display could be turned off for night time use- sometimes the flickering of the humidity levels is enough to be disruptive to sleep.  My solution was to turn the face of the unit away from the bed but I can still see the flickers on the wall.  NOT a deal breaker by any stretch though
878,Good purchase,Bought this humidifier to help with the low humidity in my house during the winter. We run a pellet stove during the winter for heat and the house gets really dry. So far the humidifier has kept humidity at a good level. Its very quiet and easy to refill.
879,Wish I knew of this brand sooner,"Very simple setup, very easy to link to my smart home via Google home, very easy to clean (the app reminding me once a week helps!!), and I love the app notifications if it runs empty, or if I lift the reservoir off the base without turning it off first.

Setting up the humidistat to 45% and letting it run on auto is a blessing, but you need to download the app to alter the humidistat. The sleep/night mode? Beautiful and keeps the room dark. The noise level? It's on my bedside table, running, and it's noise level is similar to the teeniest tiniest air leak coming out of a pool toy you're trying to patch, but you just can't seem to find the tiny leak for the life of ya because it's THAT small and That quiet. Highly recommend this if you need a humidifier."
880,Meets all of my requirements,"Meets all of my requirements: large tank, top fill and versatile app.  It is handy to be able to control through an app where I can schedule the humidifier to turn on at a specific time. The auto mode works great so far for the past three weeks. The app also informs me the humidity level of the room when I am not home which is important for me to make sure my plants are happy."
881,DO NOT BUY THIS,"Product does not have de-mineralization feature. Leaves white dust , minerals from the water, all over floors, furniture, any flat surface. Does not state this on description. Zero stars"
882,Should be able to calibrate it.,"Works well, I like the size of it don¡¯t have to refill no where near as much as my old one. Love the fact I can controller it using the app on my phone but really bothers me I can¡¯t calibrate it to match my other Hygrometers."
883,Much better than my first one,This humidifier is a lot better than the first one I bought in holes a lot more water and last through the whole night excellent
884,Well made and effective,"I like the quietness of this humidifier and the ability to turn off all lights and displays while it is running. For fine control, you must use the Vesync app. However, the factory defaults we're fine, out of the box."
885,"Defective, tank leaks",First time water was put in the tank it started dripping water where the white bottom meets the clear tank.  I was hoping this was a good purchase as I have had a different  Levoit for a couple of years and like it. Very disappointed and am returning.
886,VeStync,"what a huge disappointment!  my master bedroom is 16 x 17 or 272 sq. ft.  i have a thermometer in the bedroom, which also reads humidity.  if i place that within two feet of the humidifier, they both have the same reading.  if i put my thermometer on the other side of the room, the best reading i get is 40%.

on auto, i have used several settings, 50%, 60%, and 80%.  when the humidifier hits those numbers, it shuts down and never comes back on again.  i have to restart the unit.  it reads 35%, which matches the reading on my thermometer.

this smart humidifier isn't so smart.  it's a good thing she's pretty.  small footprint, light (without the water), and doesn't make a sound.  too bad it doesn't do what she's supposed to do.  back she goes!"
887,Turns off on its own after 5 minutes,"This humidifier shuts off on its own, saying the tank is empty even when it's full. It lasts for about 5 minutes before it shuts itself off."
888,Does the job but humidity reading inaccurate,"If you need a good basic humidifier, this is fine.  It's quiet, easy to fill and connects via wifi so you can turn on sleep mode on your phone if you've already hopped into bed. However, do not rely on the humidity level sensor.  It remained unchanged in my apt after 3 days (26%), so I bought a hygrometer- I was concerned that the humidity was actually getting too high.  And the hygrometer, says levels are 20 points higher than the humidifier says.  Too much humidity is not a good thing either."
889,"Makes loud noise, super buggy.",Makes a really annoying whirring noise when on. Within a week it broke and now turns off saying the tank is empty when it's full.
890,Love this smart humidifier,"I¡¯ve had my Levoit humidifier for about 3 weeks and I love it. The best features are the top filling tank; super easy to set up the WiFi on the app; much easier to clean than my old Levoit (probably about 5 years old) and most of all I love that I can set it while I¡¯m away from home.
Alerts include empty tank and ¡°time to clean your humidifier¡± which is really nice.
I have a 1.5 gallon water purifier that I leave in my refrigerator and use only for refilling the humidifier. Buying distilled bottles is costly and I don¡¯t have the room to store them. The trade off from buying filters for the purifier is much cheaper than buying gallons of distilled water.
I highly recommend!"
891,Extremely impressed,"My boyfriend isn¡¯t convinced I didn¡¯t spend hundreds on this humidifier, it works that well. Silent, doesn¡¯t steam up the place with a somehow cool mist, and shows you what the humidity is in your space."
892,Lasted a week,No data display response at first. Now it shows no water even though filled. Would be a good product if it worked. I have used it a week! Amazon is sending a replacement. I will give it another opportunity to work properly!  Just received the replacement unit and noticed a part INSIDE THE TANK on the new unit was NOT ON THE OLD UNIT BEING RETURNED>!
893,Not worth the price.,"The best things about this unit are the top load and it is easy to clean.
The wifi connection is worthless and doesn't make this thing have anymore controll unless you are to lazy to get up off the couch to turn it on or off. I bought this under the impression I could be very precise with the humidity settings. I thought this could be controller by 1% increments. This would turn out to be false. There is no more control with this unit than with a cheaper analog style unit. I believe that a dial adjustment unit can be controlled more that this digital one. You only get a low, med, high, or auto setting even when using the app. I was hoping to set the unit at say 43% and it would maintain that. Not the case. The only setting that does something similar is Auto mode, which will shut off at 50% and come back on when it goes below this. All the other settings, even with app, only allow low, med, high.
This product is not worth the money. If you are looking for precise control, buy something else. If you don't need precise control, buy somethung cheaper."
894,Smart and easy,"Love this humidifier. Works great I love that it lasts from 3-7 days depending on my apartment. I have a small 1 BR , I keep this in my living room and it seems to take care of my entire place. It has auto mode which is great cause I sure don¡¯t know these things of humidity lol. Also you can hook it up to ur wifi! I can lay in bed and turn the night light on it or crank it up turn it off, great feature. If I ever need another one I will reorder from here!"
895,Good value,Good value and works with other levoit products And Alexa integration well
896,Happy at first but..,"This product leaks all over with no warning. It completely overflows. It has ruined my carpet. It works great, when it¡¯s not leaking."
897,So quiet and has auto mode,"Quiet and with auto mode, you can just leave it on and it will run if needed."
898,Great working humidifier,Set in low the water level will last for a couple days. Nice moist air.
899,Awesome Humidifier,Love our new little room humidifier. Very quiet and very powerful. Runs for a long time on a tank of water. I usually get close to 36 hours on one tank but I understand that can differ due to settings and temp. I am glad my wife purchased this humidifier. The static electricity is pretty much gone in our home.
900,Don¡¯t buy this one . . .,"I bought this based on good reviews however I did not have the same luck. The first one leaked between the top and the base. Amazon did send me a replacement (I had to wait over two weeks for delivery) but after 2 weeks of use, it leaked in the same spot. I¡¯ll be asking for a refund and looking for another brand."
901,Great humidifier,It is so quiet I cannot tell when its on or off!  I love the ability to set a schedule and control everything from my phone. I like the large water container that is so easy to refill. I highly recommend this.
902,Perfect watering system for my orchids!,"With this humidifier I don't have to worry about my orchids. I can set multiple schedules and adjust the misting level from my phone!  The tank is big enough to run about 5 days without refilling, so I don't have to worry about my orchids."
903,Leaks almost every time - between base and tank.,"Looked good, but that is about it.  It leaked the first time it was used.  Fortunately, I caught it before it did any damage.  Checked everything out and did not see anything obviously wrong.  Tried it again, at a safer location (in a bathtub).  It leaked again.  Gave it 1 more try.  Seemed to be working fine, no leaks, until a couple of hours later when I could see water dripping out between the base and the tank.  3 strikes you are out!

I considered getting a replacement, but based on this unit's design, I would NEVER be comfortable leaving it operating unattended so what is the point!  I have another humidifier that has to be >10 years old and has never leaked.

Be careful with this unit..."
904,Great humidifier for the money,"We love the sleek design and quiet automatic operation.  Only drawback is you have to use the app on your phone to change desired humidity level.  Since we rarely change the setting, it is not a big deal.  Also like the fact you can turn off the display which is pretty bright at night."
905,"Easy to setup, works great","The smart features are really cool and easy to setup and use. I like that I can set it to a certain desired humidity level and it will automatically maintain it. The huge water container is great too, so I don't have to refill it as often. Refilling is convenient since I can just pour water into the top. I love that it sends me a phone notification when it runs out of water."
906,Disappointed,"This is an extremely great and well made humidifier for your bedroom. Quite, efficient and space saver.
However the humidity displayed in the unit and in the app are way off. For me to be able to get to 50 my preferred humidity I have to use it in manual mode.
Very disappointed that I cannot use the auto set mode. I expect this to be corrected and all like me who purchased it with this false advertisement to be compensated"
907,"Great humidifier, but beware different hardware revisions","I have two of these, and both are good. The first one I received does not work properly when the tank is full¡ªit needs to be at most 1/2 to 2/3 full or else it won¡¯t feed water into the base.

The second one works perfectly, though its tank is NOT interchangeable with the first one! (A minor flood revealed this.)

The VeSync app control works very well, and maybe one day we will get HomeKit compatibility. (There are some partial solutions involving Homebridge.)

Overall, it¡¯s very quiet and tidy, and does the job well. So far, Levoit has been responsive regarding the issue I am having with the first unit. I would update this review to 5 stars if they  resolve that issue without too much struggle, because the second one I have is without flaws."
908,Is quiet but tough to clean,"Where do I begin?

Yes, it's quiet. Yes, it's probably better than nothing, but ...

It seems to have NO idea what the humidity number is supposed to be; it jumps around constantly. Not the biggest deal, but still ...

And my version of ""easy to clean"" doesn't involve multiple tasks. I just can't recommend this. Seems like there are better ones out there.

Today I figured, after a week's use, I'd clean it. After all, it's supposed to be easy!  Not true.

Their words, slightly paraphrased:

1. Fill the tank with 3 US cups distilled white vinegar. Swish around.
2. Place  tank on base, let soak for 20 minutes. Vinegar will drain into base. Pour vinegar out.
3. Flip tank over and remove the noise silencer. Press the release tab and gently pull away from the humidifier.
4. Remove the float from base ... shows pictures. Not simple.
5. Place float and noise silencer in small container filled with vinegar to cover. Soak for 20 minutes.
6. Use soft cloth and the included brush to clean scale away.
7. Rinse all parts to lose vinegar smell.

Figure out how to put the blooming thing back together again.

Easy to clean?????? I don't think so! I'd return it in a heartbeat if I could."
909,Great but does not work on 5GHz wifi networks,"This just arrived today and it is easy to use and totally silent even on high. It looks to be super easy to clean though will need a bottle brush to clean the stem tube, but it is easy to access unlike the standard ones. See picture.
Only problem is it will not connect to my phone since I have high speed Internet (work from home) so using the auto function for a desired humidity does not appear to be an option. I also purchased the Levoit warm/cold humidifier (slightly more expensive) as a comparison and I may like it better solely because of the ability to adjust humidity. Plan on keeping both as I will set up in different rooms but may recommend the later one unless you still have 2.4GHz network."
910,Great Humidifier,"Love this humidifier! We use it in our bedroom at night and just like that, no more headaches or nose bleeds in the morning. It is very quiet and can be set to come on before we go to bed!!! The humidifier can be accessed with your cellphone and you can fire it up when the mood strikes you. I currently have ours set to come on 2 hours prior to bed time, then it shuts off all lights and displays at bedtime, then it shuts off in the morning to save some water. I highly recommend this product! It is perfect for bed rooms, but isn't quite big enough for the whole home."
911,Sophisticated simplicity,"At first I was frustrated with this humidifier. The buttons didn't seem to respond; it went on and off for no rhyme or reason and the whole idea of using an app to control a humidifier made my luddite head explode. But after some time with it I realized that the house always seemed comfortable with zero attention on my part and I really appreciated the button that turns off the display. Eventually I realized that the buttons are touch sensitive and I don't need to be pressing forcefully. Reading the instructions I learned that the humidifier is already set up to keep the room at around 50% humidity, which was what I wanted anyway, hence the seemingly random on and off.
So you can literally just fill this thing with water, plug it in, turn it on and forget about it.
Grudgingly, I did eventually download the app and in seconds I programmed the one in the bedroom to turn off during the day and on at night and the one in the living room to do the reverse.
Honestly, I can't remember the last time a product worked so flawlessly and did the job it's intended for with such ease. Highly recommended."
912,Great Customer Service!,"Our humidifier shipped quickly and we started using it right away in our apartment and it was working great for 10 days and then we came home from church to find some water on the floor.  It seemed that the valve that allows some water into the base but stops when it reaches a certain point had not stopped.

I contacted customer service and they were very helpful and are shipping us a brand new humidifier, which is why I am giving this product 5 stars!  I really do like the humidifier and hope that we won't have this issue with the 2nd one as I now appreciate it even more as I've been having itchy, dry skin and a dry mouth without the humidity it added to our home."
913,Love!,"In love with this product! It truly is amazing. Connects as expected, works like a charm. Customer service is quick to answer any questions. I found my forever humidifier!"
914,Leaks!,Worked for a few weeks and then suddenly started leaking around the base.
915,Don't waste your money,This humidifier does not work. It constantly tells me the water tank is empty when it's clearly not and is very full. It will stop working randomly in the middle of the night. I have to go in and pick up the tank off the base and put it back on to register that there is water in it. I was intrigued about the ability to control it from an app but it's so unreliable that I cannot recommend this product.
916,Quite and effective,I have mine connected to my Alexa and love it!! It works great. I change the water each day and the app reminds me to clean it once a week. It came with two pads for essential oils but I haven¡¯t tried adding that. Really I love that it goes 5 above and then waits till 5 below the target humidity so start up again. Even though it¡¯s super quiet it¡¯s not constantly kicking on and off. We want to get another one for the living room and put them on a schedule.
917,Stopped working after 3 months,their website support from Amazon doesn't work. It's stopped working after 3 months use with schedule (about 12 hours/ day)
918,Doesn't actually humidify,"Doesn't actually add humidity to the air. Mines been on max output for 24 hours and I've filled the tank once already and yet the humidity in the room hasn't increased at all. It's been 47% since before I plugged the thing in and hasn't risen at all. 47% is unacceptably low for max output on a highly rated, large space humidifier (my room is 250sq/f, half the max space for this model). I'll put on a fan tonight to see if blowing it around helps, but i don't have much faith as some other reviews say the same."
919,Easy to fill,I am pleased with the humidifier it works well in my bedroom to keep the room air moist. No more waking up with a dry nose and mouth. I like that I can control it with Alexia so it allows me to turn it on or off while in bed.
920,Great item,"The humidifier is very quiet. It displays the relative humidity in the area it is working on and gradually regulates to 50% throughout the day. The tank usually only needs to be filled once daily (depending on where you live) for us in Alaska. Overall, very happy with it."
921,Hopelessly inadequate,"Ran for over 2 hours at maximum mist (9) and maximum target humidity (60%) but could not change humidity 12 inches away on independent humidity monitor or even on its own current humidity monitor. Room is roughly 12¡¯x20¡¯ (300 sq. ft.). It is quiet and probably easy to clean but just doesn¡¯t alter humidity in measurable way. In other words, it doesn¡¯t work."
922,So quiet I had to keep checking that it was working the first night...,"Take a little time with the instruction manual to learn this product and to treat it right. The manual alone might tell you the quality of the entire product. It's light, easy to use, diverse (even includes a night light), and effective. I haven't tried the aromatherapy feature yet, but that's the plan for today. This seems like a product that might last a long time providing I follow the instructions."
923,High volume and good quality.,I love that I can control this humidifier with an app! It has a large bucket so it lasts way longer than others I¡¯ve tried. It¡¯s quiet for my but my husband can hear it. A little annoying to clean but worth it!
924,Very nice humidifier,"This is a super-nice humidifier. I love the VeSync app -- nice to control the humidifier from my recliner chair (smile). I don't really smell the fragrance from the essential oil I sprinkled onto the ""fragrance pad"" -- but that's a minor thing. I have 2 diffusers in the room anyway. I recommend this humidifier."
925,High pitched awful noise," It makes a very high pitched chirp that is unbearable. This noise changes with each level, but it is present with every level of the humidifier (auto, low, medium, high). I've tried the manufacturer's suggestions (basically to power off, unplug and empty the base) but the noise is still present. It is so high pitch that my microphone has a hard time recording it. Very annoying, headache inducing."
926,The humidifier that was sent didn¡¯t work.,The original humidifier that was sent didn¡¯t work. Must have been a malfunction since water leaked everywhere. I didn¡¯t even fill the water up to the water line.. it was way below and still water leaked from the bottom. The downloading of the app and how quickly it connected to my wifi and device is the only reason I went and submitted for a replacement. My husband and I love technology and how quickly it connected to Alexa was everything.. just the humidifier didn¡¯t work smh. I will do another review once my replacement comes next week.
927,Perfect humidifier,"Love everything, super quiet, easy to fill and clean."
928,Lives up to expectations,"Though I am not a great fan of humidifiers, and have had some less than positive experiences in the past, my doc insisted I get one.  This one works like a charm.  It is quite effective.  Everyday I am becoming happier I tried this one.  It is well made and reasonably easy to clean and maintain.  Controlling it from the app on my phone that also reads current humidity levels is very helpful.  The only slightly critical comment is that it does not work very well as an essential oils diffuser (and yes, I followed directions).  But, my first and foremost reason to buy it was having a well made and effective humidifier, so I did not dock this a star because of the diffuser."
929,"Top fill very convenient, Very efficient use of water",The top fill is very easy to use. Wide opening. Uses water efficiently. Goes all day in my house. I replace water about every 2 days.
930,Highly recommend! Love the app,"So easy to set up, and we love the app. It¡¯s quieter than other Levoit humidifiers we¡¯ve had before, the humidify percentage is so useful, and it holds A LOT of water. Highly, highly recommend!"
931,A Well- Behaved Machine,"Works silently, Wi Fi connectivity is easy, well designed and engineered."
932,IOS application does not work,Application does not work on IOS. Application developer stated they are aware of the problem. I bought this for someone who expects that functionality. Poor communication between developer and manufacture.  Even more surprising Amazon is left out of the loop. Now it is sitting with me not fully functional. Take a pass on this one until everyone is working together. This product should have shipped or listed for sale with limitations listed especially when they were known by the manufacturer. Limitations should have been mentioned to the buyer. The sellers for this device should be placed on some corrective action plan / pulled from Amazon until properly able to sell under Amazons conditions. Not allowed to list without the term new version which works without limitation.
933,This is my Third humidifier and it is wonderful,I have had two other humidifiers of a different brand and what makes the LEVOIT stand out is that it actually works as it supposed to. It is able to keep the humidity within the set range without erroring out and consuming about half the water the others did.  I haven't cleaned it yet so don't know how hard it will be but looks very straightforward.  It is extremely easy to fill and the 6 l capacity is a definite trip saver. Add the wifi remote control and sleep mode it is a winner.  I have already recommended it to a friend who was admiring it's good looks.
934,Quietest Humidifier I Ever Owned,"This is our first top loading humidifier and we love it! IT's really quiet, easy to load and easy to clean - a big plus! We've been using it about a week and no leaking, none of the other problems I have read about in other reviews. Thinking about getting a second one for the study."
935,*BUYER BEWARE* Flooded sons bedroom!,"This faulty machine has now cost me thousands of dollars in repairs. This was being used in my sons room and we woke up to find the entire unit had drained onto the dresser, into his drawers and flooded his floor. His dresser paint is all chipped and drawers are warped, our Hatch sound machine is shot, baby monitor camera is shot, books are soaked and ruined and our wood floors are warped and ruined. This machine was not over filled and was running on the auto setting at 43%. There is a white rubber stopper on the inside bottom left of the tank that does not seal. As soon as we filled the tank back up to see if there was a leak or crack, water just spilled straight out of the bottom. This is a major flaw that is not only extremely dangerous considering the unit was close to the outlet it was plugged in to in my sons bedroom, but we now have thousands of dollars in repairs because of this. I truly don¡¯t even have words right now to describe my disbelief and anger! We also purchased a second one of these humidifiers for our room and I cannot risk this happening again."
936,Item start to crack,Item start to crack.  Have cracks down both sides and in front panels.  I would not recommend or buy again.
937,"Silent, great size","Amazed how quiet this is - absolutely silent to my ears!! The tank is large, but not too heavy when full. I only buy humidifiers with top-fill tanks, and this is the best I¡¯ve ever owned. We keep the light turned on because it¡¯s so quiet you don¡¯t know whether it¡¯s running except to see the light in the tank or the steam. The light also makes the steam easier to see when other lights in the room are dimmed.

We¡¯ve enjoyed it for a few months and will buy a second one due to the size of our home. I haven¡¯t tried cleaning it yet, but this one looks easy enough."
938,Good humidifier but not so smartÿ,"True to the reviews this humidifier worked great as a smart humidifier for two days. Then it refused to connect to Wifi and now randomly shuts itself off. Sometimes it shuts itself off and stays discoverable which is fun. It¡¯s a shame the app is neat and works great when it works. But it¡¯s useless as a smart humidifier at this point. Unplugging it sometimes resets it to work, sometimes it doesn¡¯t. It¡¯s not worth the hassle. Will keep it as a regular humidifier I guess. That works decent enough. For now."
939,Great until its not great anymore.,"I really thought I had it this time, after waiting for a few years to buy another mister, My mister made it almost one month before it constantly throws error code it has no water even after replacing tank and putting it back on and off."
940,Ad based app.,I don't like the fact that the app. for this product is ad based.  I don't need to see ads when I'm using the Levoit app.
941,works really well even in my drafty old house,"My house gets pretty dry in the winter, I have humidity sensors throughout the house and putting this in my living room it actually did appreciably increase humidity throughout the house. It's practically silent too.

I had previously tried an evaporative humidifier based on some bad internet advice, it didn't increase the humidity at all, was a big hassle to keep clean and filled with water, and evaporative humidifiers all seem to be much more expensive for the size of water tank than ultrasonic. Why do they exist? Just get this instead, less cost and less hassle, and it actually works."
942,I googled the best humidifier. LEVOIT it was. And it is!!!,"It definitely quiet.
It¡¯s design makes sense.
Money well spent."
943,Leaked when turned off,I had to return this humidifier because after using it once it leaked all over and also didn't start up when turned on.  The base was overflowing with water and had to emptied. I called support and the information that they gave me was to empty and clean the unit after every use.  That seems excessive and the unit went back.  I purchased another brand that I have used before and should have bought in the first place.
944,The App is absolute junk! Does not send alerts anymore,I run this humidifier 24/7 in my greenhouse and my favorite feature is when it notifies me when the tank is empty or when it needs to be cleaned. However for some reason it no longer notifies me. I did not touch the notification settings at all. Why would I? That was my favorite feature about this unit. Tried reaching out for help through the Vesync app and it would not allow me to submit a report. And yes I properly clean the the entire unit on time per their instructions. Save your money if this is why you¡¯re buying the humidifier
945,Quite and humidifies well,"It's quite, it does at it advertises and the app actually works well.  OK Google and Alexa commands both work well also.  I have not checked myself but from what others write, set it a bit higher than your actual goal RH.  I set mine at 55% for a room of 45% RH."
946,Just got it and so far it¡¯s great,Really quite and easy to use
947,Great product,"Works perfect, especially with the app you can download to your cellphone"
948,A nice unit but high cost to run,"I really like this humidifier, but if you are using distilled water you should know it will use a lot. We go through a gallon of it a day on low to keep the room at 40% humidity. That's over $30 a month for the water!"
949,Quiet humidifier!!,"Quiet humidifier, easy to use. Using wifi, can turn it on and schedule the time to run and turn off without going into the room where the humidifier is located. Does a great job."
950,Auto mode works great through the app,Kept saying low water when it was full. I emptied the water and realized the plug mechanism was a little weak/cheap and held closed by the weight of the water and it is pushed open by a float when the water gets low in the bottom. Just put less water in the tank and it works perfectly now.
951,Does Not Regulate Humidity,"I bought this humidifier to regulate humidity. I thought this humidifier did however it ""regulates"" it within 10%. That is way too big of a window! For example, if you set it to 50% it will automatically kick off when it reaches 55% and then kick back on when it reaches 45%. Why so big of a window? If you are also trying to regulate a tight humidity level this is not the humidifier for you."
952,Look elsewhere.....read on to see why,"So instead of hitting the ""set humidity"" range and maintaining that range.....it just shut off once it reached it and never turned back on....even with the app.
Save your time and money. Try another brand. POS! If you want a ""set n forget"" range type humidifier, this isn't it.
Trust me, ive tried dozens of manufacturers and this was the worst."
953,Best humidifier I have owned,"I had 2 LEVOIT Humidifiers. One is for my house plants and another one is for my kid's room.
First of all, the WIFI function is very useful for me to check on my plants which is exactly what i was looking for and plus with 6L water tank.
The humidifier is quiet that my kid never complained about the noise anymore. Top filling is easy, my little one helps me to do it sometimes as well.

The only thing that i hope if is a temperature sensor included will be prefer for me."
954,Works well,I like it. Takes filtered water
955,Can¡¯t get to target humidity no matter what I do.,"There are many positive features of this humidifier. Unfortunately, it doesn¡¯t seem to ever reach the humidity I need. Regardless of whether I set the target humidity to the highest level for auto or set it to the highest output on manual, I can¡¯t get the room to ever reach a humidity higher than 30%, which isn¡¯t really in the recommended range.
Nice humidifier, but really doesn¡¯t work as well as it could with regard to maintaining humidity."
956,Humidifier is quite but Auto mode is a gimmick,"Humidifier is very quiet and the app works great to control the device remotely. But the auto mode is way off! I had set my Target humidity at 44% but the humidifier never starts automatically to reach this level. It keeps falling below 40% till the point I have to manually switch it from auto to Manual mode and then it starts the misting process. Funny part is, after hitting manual when I switch it to auto mode after a minute or so, the humidifier doesn't turn off but goes way beyond the Target level till I have to stop it on my own. I have seen the device reaching 55% humidity on auto mode with no signs of turning off or slowing down at all. Not sure if this a feature of the product or the device I got is defective!"
957,Best Humidifier I have Ever Bought,I have gone through a lot of humidifiers. This thing is super quiet and works amazingly. The app is super user-friendly and setup was a breeze.  The cleaning of this is super simple also. I will be buying a few more for my other bedrooms and living room.
958,Best hunting own !,"I have 4 different humidifiers in our house and this is by far the best we own. I use this one in our bedroom and it¡¯s a must have if you run a heat pump. Love the night mode , don¡¯t need any lights glowing all night long."
959,Very happy with purchase,"Quite, Compact and works great.  I love the options to connect to Alexa or phone ap.  We chose the Alexa connection.  It was a little difficult to figure out but the instructions were good.  I¡¯m disabled and having the voice control is perfect for my use.  We bought 2 for the bedrooms and it¡¯s one of the best purchases on Amazon I¡¯ve made."
960,Keeps shutting off saying it is out of water," It set up super easy, the app was super easy to set up as well. Ran for 5 minutes fine, but now it just keeps shutting off saying it is OUT OF WATER!  I have taken the water tank out and put it back in. There are no other troubleshooting steps in the manual. I think the thing is not working properly and has to go back. UGH!!!"
961,Great Humidifier and even better customer service,"I bought two of these to use in my grow tents.  The tank lasts me 1.5-2 days before needing refilling in a 3x3x7 and 2x2.5x6 tent.  The Bluetooth connectivity is a game changer.  Since these are in my grow tents i my basement, they are out of sight and the VeSync app on my phone keeps me informed on how they are doing.  The VeSync app alerts me on everything from needing to refill the water, to the current humidity, allows me to change the humidity, and even reminds me when to clean them.  I can't say enough good things about these humidifiers!

I can also say that Levoit customer service is stellar!  While cleaning one of my humidifiers, I dropped the float mechanism that allows water to drain from the tank into the chamber that vaporizes the water.  I reached out to Levoit to see if I could buy a replacement part as this was clearly my fault and not defect or malfunction.  Customer service informed me that they were not able to send me a new float but as a gesture of good will they sent me a brand new humidifier!

What can I say, the product is great and the customer service goes above and beyond.  If you were hesitant about buying this humidifier don't be!"
962,Not User Friendly!,"We have three Levoit air filters in our home, and love them.....so easy to replace the filters, they are quiet, and they clean the air.  So I had no hesitation in ordering a Levoit humidifier for our bedroom.  Big mistake!  The directions for setting the controls to ""automatic"" and ""smart settings"" were confusing, and it appears that I need to reset those controls every day and night, because the humidifier doesn't come on during the night (based on the water level).  I decided to clean the humidifier this weekend, which was a multi-hour task if you include the ""soaking"" times specified in the instructions.  The humidifier is quiet, when it is working, but that's about the only good thing I can say about the machine at this point.  I've reached out to ""customer service,"" and have gotten a couple of responses to specific questions, but am seriously considering sending this back.  Can't quite figure out why it gets such good reviews online."
963,"Reasonably nice humidifier, but no durability","Nice top filling tank. Great noise level. Good amount of vapor production. Unfortunately none of that matters because between the device not functioning properly and malfunctioning app, the device isn¡¯t worth the money.
My initially purchased humidifier was malfunctioning the first day I used it, and the manufacturer was able to replace it with another in a timely fashion, which was appreciated.
The new unit they had sent me functioned one month without incident before it¡¯s WiFi fuctionality began to degrade and now the humidifier in question will not turn on at all.
Clearly there is a quality control issue. And now since I am out of the return window I won¡¯t be refunded for my humidifier that is now just a small container to hold water.
I wanted to like the unit, and I thought that due to its price I would be buying a superior product to some of the cheaper brands available, but unfortunately that doesn¡¯t seem to be the reality of the situation."
964,Will not stay on. Shuts off after 2 minutes of using.,I don¡¯t ever write a review butÿ. It will not stay on. It shuts off after a couple minutes of using. It says trouble shooting but I¡¯ve already emptied the water out and started over several times. This product is way too much money not to work at all. 0 starsÿ at least my Vicks humidifier worked!
965,"Best humidifier, (I've tried 5 others)","Took me a long time to actually invest in a ""more expensive humidifier"" but what's actually expensive is the other, crappy, cheap, mold-prone, non-stop running humidifiers. I've gone through 5 other brands and I should've known levoit would hit it out of the park  (I also own 2 levoit air purifiers)

This one is unbeatable. I always have it on auto so it auto-detects the humidity and adjusts as needed. I haven't needed to refill it in 3 days so far and it came with a full set of cleaning instructions including a little brush. ( I've been using toothbrushes) I'm so happy with this purcahse."
966,Works great,This thing is great. I have this device as well as 3 300s Hepa filters and a 200s Hepa filter. All by Levoit. There products are amazing. All there products work and work well.
967,Excellent,Excellent
968,It didn¡¯t do much to increase humidity level,"I hate to give the machine a bad review but the results just aren¡¯t where they need to be to have a positive one.  I ran the machine for two weeks and it basically did nothing to raise the humidity level in the room. In addition to not performing its primary function, it covers the room in white powder. It¡¯s completely impracticable to use distilled water to avoid the white powder issue. My water is softened and carbon filtered and in two weeks of using the humidifier I saw no increase in humidity when looking at the humidity sensor I have in the room. I¡¯m in a very arid climate with humidity normally around 22-28%. The sensor on the machine is pointless because the air coming out of the machine tends to settle around the machine giving a false sense that the machine is accomplishing its goal. The app and electronics are good and the machine looks attractive, for which I¡¯ll give one star, but it¡¯s unfortunate that it doesn¡¯t really provide any positive results. Maybe if the room was significantly small that they claim the machine will cover and you run RO or distilled water you might have better results than I did."
969,Unsafe,Started to smoke after a few uses. I threw it out.
970,Great buy!,I like that it is controllable from my phone.
971,I like it,I like it
972,product is junk,I have never been able to get this product to work.I have asked for a replacement/.
973,Levoit Humidifier,Best humidifier ever I have bought till date.
974,Dust...,Even with purified or distilled water the amount of white dust is insane. Can't use it.
975,Started Great...,"We have other Levoit products that are great, making this purchase an easy one. Unfortunately, after 2 fills, we had a pool leaking beneath the humidifier and onto our floors. The humidifier sits on a very level, very stable bookcase, properly placed from the wall and the surrounding area. Just to mention, I'm the type of person who enjoys reading instruction manuals, it's my guilty pleasure. Which makes the margin of error a slightly small one.
Regardless, I'm fairly confident the setup and placement were not at fault, but who knows.
With that being said, I wasn't super impressed with the ""nightlight"" function either. I assumed it would be a comforting glow, but it's more of a small, single Christmas light at the base of the tank, muted by a plastic dome.
When on medium output, in a large room, with a justifiable humidity, the noise level was surprisingly louder than expected. The ""bubbling"" and ""drip"" started to grow to the point of sounding like a leaky faucet echoing into a large hallway.
I'm not a big reviewer, nor am I one to assume a product is faulty within the first few uses. It's usually user fault and I'm cool with that. I'm not perfect and a quick fix to a small problem is easier than nothing done at all.
I'm more bummed about this purchase than I am frustrated. Levoit  usually makes quite reliable products, just not so much this time."
976,Very loud noise,Loud noise while using it
977,The only humidifier that does the job,This is my 4th humidifier and so far the first one that actually has changed the air humidity. Totally recommend.
978,This stopped working the day I got it.,"I am sure this is a fine humidifier, but this particular one I got stopped putting out steam in less than 24 hours, which was disappointing."
979,Love it,Perfect for our Persians and ourselves!
980,Very pleased,"The Levoit is whisper quite. The auto setting keeps the humidity level in a very comfortable range and makes the water last a long time between fills.

Our home is bone dry in winter and fall, and without this humidifier my skin and sinuses dry out badly. I am very satisfied and recommend highly.

PS my wife says it¡¯s pretty easy to clean."
981,Love it,Works as described
982,Leaks,"Leaks everywhere,"
983,Great customer service,"I love my new humidifier. I especially like the essential oil tray. However, about 60 days after receiving it, it started to leak all over my table and floor. I still can't figure out where the leak is coming from. Of course the return window was 30 days. So I wrote to Levoit and had a response back within 24 hours. They are sending a new humidifier to me now. Once I receive it and have had a chance to use it,  I will update my review. The customer service is one of the best I've dealt with. Check back in a few months."
984,"Great product!! Easy to use, easy to clean. Highly recommend!"," Easy to use, easy to clean, works with Alexa,  very quiet, you can turn all product lights off and run it through the night.  Has low, ned and high functions.  Has a night light that has 2 levels of brightness.  Love it!!!"
985,It got delivered quick,Wife likes it that¡¯s all that matters
986,Humidifier,"I love this humidifier! I searched a lot of humidifiers and I am so glad I ended up with this one, you won't be disappointed!!!"
987,Do not buy this product.,The water spills out a lot.
988,WARNING: Wants you Amazon password,"NEVER EVER USE AN APP THAT ASKS FOR A PASSWORD TO ANOTHER ACCOUNT.  Instead of using the skills these clever and nefarious folks want you to give them your Amazon password.  Who needs voice activation for a humidifier anyways...

Seems like an ok humidifier, but the whole password thing is super duper uncool."
989,Quite,"This unit is very quite and works extremely well. I have owned other units in the past, but this is the best one yet. Like very much the app that lets you control the unit."
990,Can't live without it,"Love this humidifier so much. The app updates me when they tank is empty or has been picked up. Haven't had one issue with the auto setting. Synced to my Alexa, so I don't have to touch it besides to fill or clean. We have it in our bedroom and cannot hear it while we sleep."
991,Good humidifier,Everything has been great except if the humidifier is on an angle just a little the tank will empty all over the floor.....trust me.  Other than that it was a very good buy.
992,Great Product,"If you are having issues, just remember it is a wifi-bluetooth smart humidifier.  Get the app and set it up the way you want it."
993,seems OK but does not humidify much unless set to high,"This is quiet, and I like being able to switch off the display and nightlight. But the ""auto"" function on this, which is supposed to keep room humidity at 50 per cent, does not work. It switches off when the humidity is way below 50 per cent. We have had it running for 24 hours, in fairly dry conditions of about 30 per cent humidity (according to my separate humidity measuring device, which I believe is accurate). The humidifier, which is on auto, has switched itself off in most of that time, and has used only a small amount of water in the tank. So it registers the room as being at 50 per cent humidity, when it is actually only about 30 per cent humidity. It is inaccurate. Therefore the auto function is useless. Also, if you switch off the display and nightlight, it will only run on ""auto"". So that means that at night, you have to have the display light on if you want the humidifier to work at normal strength."
994,Pretty darn good.,"I have been through several humidifier and the overall issue with the others has been. They just don't pump up a large room better than 35% maybe 40%. Not a problem for this bad boy. Running for 8 hours: Low 45%, medium 50%, Bama in the summer. Runs quiet, runs just about 60 hours as advertised on that low setting. Sleep mode shuts down the light and keeps the unit running. Can do quite a few thing attached to wifi on/off, light, change and set level. Slightly irritated I wasted good money on other bad products after buying this."
995,Awesome Glad I bought it,I live this humidifier. Never hear it! App is great! Helping a lot!
996,This humidifier is awesome,"I  really like this humidifier, I have used a boneco one for a long time, but this one is too easy.  It's easy to fill from the top and it is super quiet.  I love that I can program this to come one at bedtime and go off in the morning.  Was well worth the money for comfort."
997,Excellent machine!,We use it every night and it works well and the top fill is awesome.  Very good product!
998,Great humidifier,This humidifier works great.  Controlling it with the app is easy and gives you so much control.  Very impressed.
999,the best ever,"this is remarkable compared to my last ones. this is no noise at all, keeps my average room around 40%. I love the auto feature as all i ever do is add water. A great humidifier"
1000,"Constantly disconnects from wifi, rendering the app useless","I really liked this humidifier. And then it stopped working less than a week after I¡¯d already purchased a second one, and an air purifier by the same company. The whole reason I got this humidifier was due to the functionality by using the app - being able to control and program the unit.
Unfortunately, after less than a week it randomly disconnected from our wifi and wouldn¡¯t reconnect without deleting the entire device from the app, thus losing all my programs.
Ever since then all 3 of my units (2 humidifiers & 1 purifier) disconnect every 1-2 days randomly (not all at the same time). Once this happens I am SOL. I have a relatively complicated program that i put into place, but after the 3rd time re-entering it, I just got so fed up. So now the devices just remain off-line and out of my control, defeating the purpose here.
I reached out to customer service and they did respond, but with nothing more than blaming my wifi connection, which is not an issue with ANY other connected devices.
I explained the situation in detail over a week ago and asked for help, and I¡¯ve been ghosted.

I love how quiet the device is, and the control over the humidity percentage so it doesn¡¯t constantly run, but when I can¡¯t control any of the devices using the app and all programs are lost every time I delete a device to reset-connectÿ I just get frustrated every time I see the device, especially knowing how little help customer service was. I¡¯m just disappointed."
1001,Decent Humidifier,"It's a great humidifier. Good power. Definitely puts out some humidity. I never did it to connect to the app on my phone. I have the latest phone, fastest internet and all of that but it says signal is weak. My wifi analytics say other otherwise. Other than that I have no complaints."
1002,Good,Good
1003,Worked great at first. Now it cuts off randomly and leaks.,I bought this 6 months ago and I loved how I could use my phone to control it. At first it was working fine and then it started to cut off randomly. I messed with all the settings and it still constantly cut off. Now to top it all off the tank is leaking so I can¡¯t even use it. I recommend going with a different humidifier.
1004,Best Humidifer,Looks great works great wi-fi enabled...Holds plenty of water and you never know its on .
1005,There was no automatic  control device in the package,I did not like that the 300S model did not come with a remote control
1006,Finally! Someone got it right!,"I have been buying humidifiers since 2000, when I moved to the high desert. Every one of them was lacking somewhere - too noisy, hard to clean, distracting lights, ineffective at maintaining humidity levels.

Well, LEVOIT solved them all! I am so satisfied with the Classic 300S! It is QUIET, puts out tons of moisture! And can be controlled and SCHEDULED by a very effective APP.

In short, I love this humidifier!"
1007,Terrible,Would have returned it but they don't accept it without the original packaging. Waste of money
1008,Perfect Humidfier,"This thing does everything I could ask for a Humidifier, no issues yet."
1009,Great humidifier.,"I was very wary about buying this thing with all the reviews about leaks and it not working. I think they're doing something bad wrong because these things are brilliant.

I ordered two of them and am going to go ahead and order another one.

The only drawback to them is the fluctuation in range of humidity. When you put them on automatic, and let's say you set it to 45% humidity, it shuts off once it gets the room to 50% and doesn't turn back on again until it drops to 40%, so there's a rather large swing of 10% in there that may make you wonder if it stopped working.

It works that way by design. I wish they had set that to 2% though so that the swing wasn't so large.

That's the biggest gripe I can come up with, so that should tell you how good this thing is.

On cleaning, the container is easy to clean but you have to be very careful with the base because of all the moving parts and it's tricky to get around all of it. Just be careful and you'll be fine."
1010,Worked great for three weeks then leaked all over and eventually wouldn¡¯t turn on.,Loved this for two weeks then it entirely failed.
1011,Great product but wi-fi control not great,pumps out the water vapor is very quiet and really helps with sleep especially in the dry Colorado climate ÿ. however the wi-fi control from our phones didn¡¯t work great ÿ it would occasionally drop the link from the app and the unit wouldn¡¯t come on at the programmed time or setting. So we went back to the manual control which in some respects is easier ÿ
1012,Great Humidifier,"Compact, quiet, easy refill either taking reservoir to sink or filling with gallon jug.  Placed among some living room indoor plants to raise humidity.  Uses about 2 quarts (2 L) per 24 hours on low setting."
1013,"So easy,  comfort level is a 10+.","The Levoit Humidifier is so quiet, that during the day it doesn't  interrupt  t.v. watching, and our Humidifier in the bedroom doesn't  interrupt  sleep."
1014,"So far, works great!","Extremely quiet. Like the night light function. Also, very easy to load water and control via the app. Haven¡¯t cleaned it yet, but have high hopes"
1015,Very efficient humidifier,"As I await the closing date for my house, I am staying in my son¡¯s 100-year-old apartment in the Midwest with the steam heat and felt like I was mummifying. A humidifier is a MUST! This one is quiet, ¡°smart¡± (it stops automatically when it¡¯s within 4% of the ideal humidity), and quite effective. We have it in the living room, so It took a couple of days to get to the ideal humidity level due to the size of the space it¡¯s in, but it¡¯s working well. I thought there was a remote with it, but there is not; you put an app on your phone to control it, so that¡¯s one less small appliance to lose! Very satisfied with this purchase."
1016,Defective and no help from the company,"I was excited to unbox this product, but the unit would sometimes flash on and work, and sometimes not. I'd have to unplug it, plug it in again and keep cycling through that till sometimes--only sometimes--it went on. I sent two messages to the company, and got no response. Finally I called their 800 number, hoping to return the unit and get one that worked. The customer service person sent me a form of pictures and video which needed to be taken in order to see what was covered under warranty. I did try to do this, but the video was too large to send and so in desperation I finally am just doing a return through Amazon. I'm not sure how good this product is, but I was definitely not impressed with their customer service response times and how they handled the situation."
1017,i don¡¯t want to work alot of software ussues,the thing always turns off by self when you less expected no worth it
1018,Double warranty,Record the batch number on the bottom of the base before you fill the humidifier. You will need it to double your warranty.
1019,Excellent,We recently purchased this humidifier. We burn wood in the colder months and most of our house has exposed wood. This is super quiet and we have been having the best nights sleep. Love the night light feature. Also the Alexa feature is fantastic. We ask Alexa to turn on before we go to bed.
1020,Leaks after a couple uses,Product worked perfectly for two weeks but like what the other reviews mentioned about leaking happened to mine. Kept leaking even after i drained the water and cleaned throughly. Returned.
1021,"Good humid, but lack important feature","The humidifier works great, silent, lots of water, you can add scented oil. You can control it via app and alexa, but the major flaw is that you CAN NOT set your own humidity level."
1022,The best humidifier that I have ever bought!,"I have used this daily for over a month now.  It is quiet, easy to fill and easy to clean.

I am using filtered water in it since my local water supply is polluted with who knows what.  I thought that an app for this wasn't necessary.  I quickly found out that the app offers more control over the humidity rate and it also allows me to schedule when the unit is on and off.

I have a cockatiel that refuses to bath.  This humidifier is next to his cage and I often see him standing in the falling mist!  Without the humidifier he is constantly pulling at his feathers and audibly often sounds miserable.  He doesn't do any of that now!!"
1023,Easy compact efficient unit,I replaced my old humidifier which generated hot and cold steam. This unit only generates cols steam. It has a light which tells you how much water is left in reservoir. I like that it has a timer and you can use it via Bluetooth. I also like the consistent steam generated.
1024,High-pitched squealing,"When running on Medium or High, the motor emits a high pitched tone that is super unnerving. I tried to return this product immediately after noticing this, but I was informed I could not."
1025,Stopped working after 29 days!!,"This started out perfectly but it stopped last night exactly 29 days after starting it. :/
Naturally the return window has closed. I Suggest checking it out immediately after purchasing ."
1026,Broke after 2 months,"Bought this expensive humidifier for my apartment and it broke after 2 months. Came back to write a review of the product and it had disappeared off of Amazon so I couldn't. Winter came around and its time to order yet another humidifier and saw that they offered a full reimbursement for broken equipment w/o needing to send back.

However because of an arbitrary rule that they want you to contact them first, before disposing of it, they no longer have to honor their ""full satisfaction guaranteed"" and I wasted $70.

Would have been less insulting if they didn't dangle the reimbursement in front of me."
1027,"So far, AMAZING!","This thing is silent! I'm really impressed. Holds a lot of water, no leaking, love that it's smart and easy to use! I've had a great experience so far. 10/10"
1028,Good one,"This is one of the best humidifier I have used in the past few years. It's quiet, interface/buttons are intuitive. Tank is big. I cant complain!!"
1029,Style over substance! It LEAKS!!,"This humidifier ticks all the boxes for style: looks, smart features, good app.

However, it fails miserably when it comes to function. The mist is weak even at high levels. And most importantly, it LEAKS!!

There's a puddle of water behind the humidifier every night. And because of the leak some of the functionality is hampered and it shuts off midnight. Also, the humidity meter is not the most accurate.

Overall, will not recommend. Returning this unit."
1030,Smart Humidifier,Great product. Levoit makes great products overall. And certainly this time as well.
1031,Easy to use,"Easy to use and clean. I love that the spout on the top can rotate so you can point the mist in any direction. On mine, sleep mode turns the display off including the mist. I was hoping it would just turn off the display since it's so bright at night. Other tham that it turns itself off when it's out of water and you just fill it from the top!"
1032,Water everywhere,"I bought this for health reasons first night was great, so I thought. When I went to refill I noticed water everywhere carpet is soaked, wood table is soaked, frustrating to find before going to bed. Not too happy about this product. Parts made of cheap plastic."
1033,"Unable to connect to WiFi after cleaning, I want a replacement or refund ASAP.","Unable to connect to WiFi after cleaning, I want a replacement or refund ASAP."
1034,Works like it's supposed to,"This is much nicer then the cheap one I had ordered before, worth the money."
1035,Would buy again,"Purchased for the upcoming fall/winter (furnace season), till then it's giving my plant corner some love, which they seem to like. It's pretty darn quiet, I like there's an app and I can control it through Alexa as well."
1036,Leaks after 6 months," So this looks like my exact model but in blue. So I'll add my review to this one as well.

It leaks, it leaks BAD.  I don't know it you're aware but a couple gallons of water makes a huge mess while you're at work.  Not worth the price due to this fact.

Otherwise, Yes, amazon, it is quiet, its actually very quiet once it's emptied itself all over my floor"
1037,Leaks after 6 months - float valve doesn't always work,"Worked great for the first 3-4 months.  Now it leaks a full tank all over my floor every other week or so.

I've tried elevating it so it wouldn't run constantly which seems to help (even tho its ""supposed"" to shut off automatically) but its still leaking from some place internally.  That's the only way I would have a puddle like in the pictures uploaded.

Not sure what's causing it, but not cool

So while cleaning up the mess, I was able to watch it leak in several other places.  While taking it apart to empty it. I noticed the float was fully extended and didn't appear to do anything to stop the water from filling up over the brim."
1038,Ruined my master bedroom carpet!,"I used the product for a week and loved it. However, one Friday night as I was going to bed, I went to turn on the product but noticed the tank was empty. The issue was I had filled the tank in the morning. So, I had 2 liters or so of water leak out of the unit and onto my master bedroom carpet!  While it was ¡®just water¡¯, it was still 2L of water which has left a large ¡®ring¡¯ in the center of the carpet and obviously leaked through to the padding under the carpet. Surely mold will now form so I¡¯m a little more than upset!  I can¡¯t believe after one week of use, the seals broke and leaked.  And yes, I had it on a table that was about two feet off the ground. So annoyed."
1039,Not recomended!,I have bought more than one Levoit and they don't last more than one season.
1040,Didn't know it was possible to hate a humidifier,"I bought two. It is impossible to turn them on. You push the power button and either nothing happens or something randomly blinks. By some lottery, it eventually does what it should. It emits a horrible continuous screech, like a bat, while it is on. Impossible to sleep with it. The app is creepy and makes you use your location just to set up a humidity level. I couldn't get my units to connect to the wifi at all. They were 5 feet away and kept saying there was no network."
1041,Pretty good!,"I like that this one is really easy to fill and gives off a good amount of mist. The only issue is navigating the app. Once you have it figured out, it¡¯s great!"
1042,Didn't work correctly,"I was optimistic that the other negative reviews were a fluke, but (conveniently right after the return window closed...) the hygrometer broke. The picture shows the discrepancy between two hydrometers, which means I can no longer automatically regulate the humidity in the room. Very irritating."
1043,The best humidifier!,Best humidifier out there. Large storage tank with easy access to clean. Bluetooth and Alexa Voice control works seamlessly. Love that the humidifier has a sensor and an auto mode that can keep the humidity level in the room optimum. Very powerful!
1044,So glad I bought this,Love it works great and has improved my sleeping I recommend this product
1045,Best humidifier yet...,"The quietest and most efficient humidifier purchased to date. AUTO mode is efficient and accurate. Perfect stream of moisture and the scent slot is a treat although not so long lasting.  Does not have remote but since AUTO mode works so well, you can set and forget it until you need to refill the tank."
1046,Best out on the market,"Best out on the market.  Extremely quiet, great. Performance"
1047,"It leaks so terribly, you won¡¯t want to use it ever",It leaks like a sleeping 3 year old who drank 2 gatorades immediately before going to sleep.
1048,"Totally Inaccurate Humidity Sensor, won't turn on in auto mode","I use a woodstove to heat my house and it gets very, very dry.  I bought this to keep a room at ~50%F relative humidity to protect my music instruments. The unit will only start humidifying in auto mode when below 50%. As you can see, the humidity sensor is way off, to the point that it will never turn the humidifier on. I was expecting a few degrees off, not 20."
1049,Whisper quiet. Really,So easy to set up & fill. You can remove the tank  to fill or fill on the unit.  Easy to set controls. I was skeptical when  it said  quiet  but i can barely hear  any  noise. Glad I bought 2
1050,Helps me breathe and control my coughing,Love this machine. Quite and night light help me when I get up at night for bathroom
1051,Works AMAZING with Alexa,"I love this thing, Ive never had connection issues and it paired up super easy with my Alexa. The internal hygrometer is at least 2-7% off. I have it set to 55 and my bedroom hygrometer says its 47, I like to keep humidity up for my plants but thats not a big deal because it is so consistent.

The huge reservoir is incredible, I sometimes go several days without having to fill it, highly recommended."
1052,Stopped working like it used to,"At first it was amazing quite and super perfect goood mist flow.

A week later item is super loud sounds like a refrigerator and it leaks and the mist comes out in constant puffs rather than a smooth mist like it used to"
1053,Broke after a month. Leaking water everywhere,Hard to tell from picture but this humidifier worked for a month then one day found it was in a huge puddle of water. Very dangerous when you have water and electricity mixed. Do not buy!
1054,"Lots of buttons, but no control","They put a beautiful (and way way way too bright) display on this thing. Despite the fancy appearance, really don't have much control. Low, Medium, and High will all make a room 100% humid eventually, and High will do it within 8 hours or so. Auto maintains between 40 and 60, and you don't have much control over it beyond that.  I have to turn it off at night so I can sleep (REALLY bright).  And this is with the device's light set to off (that makes it even brighter). Would not recommend really."
1055,Product quality,This product stopped working
1056,To be determined,"I purchased two of these humidifier. Seems to be very delicate to the touchÿ easily broken. If you buy this be gentle. No probs with app so far. It does not put out a lot of steam. My humidity levels doesn¡¯t snt change much in a medium size room getting below 60% has not happened. I have heat pumps so the air is dry.
I¡¯ll update my review after a few months."
1057,Perfect for newborns,"Great product! Works great, not noisy, Bluetooth is awesome too!"
1058,The water tank splits down the side when temp is to cold,
1059,Very happy with this humidifier,Bought this mostly for my plants but it seems to be working pretty well in my studio apartment according to my nest thermostat 6 or so meters away. Since running it for my plants I have already noticed a lot of new growth. I maintain 70% humidity meaning it keeps it between 65-75. It seems to empty out the tank about every 3 days and it's super easy to refill from the top. Pretty small so it doesn't take up much space and the design is nice. I do wish the app had more features including a water level indicator and alerts for low water but I can't find much else to complain about especially considering the price. Compared to other models I've looked at I think this is one of the best smart humidifiers out there at this price point.
1060,wroth every dollar.,I highly recommend this! I use it for my plants but also if anyone is sick etc. Its amazingly powerful and dont have to constantly refill it.
1061,Love it!,Works great!  Easy to fill and lasts all day and all night.  Alerts us on our phone when it¡¯s out of water.  Thinking of getting another one too!
1062,Terrific Humidifer,I had to replace my old humidifier the knob on it would no longer turn it on and off.  This one is so much nicer. It has buttons you touch to turn it on. Very easy to use and I'm really glad I chose it.
1063,Returning!,Returning! Wanted this to replace a very old Vicks humidifier. This one looks good but stopping working a few days in. Water tank is filled and it says there¡¯s no water in it and won¡¯t turn on. Followed troubleshooting guide and still nothing after several days and attempts. Don¡¯t like that it requires Wi-Fi to operate and doesn¡¯t have a remote unlike the image posted. Easy to clean and looks good means nothing if it won¡¯t turn on. Returning. Save yourself time.
1064,Completely broke apart like something ate away ate it,"Weirdest thing, went to fill it up and it just broke apart from the base almost like glass."
1065,Low noise,Low noise
1066,Good smart humidifier,Its a good smart humidifier for those who like to control it via alexa. Its super easy to clean. Mist level and humidity can be easily controlled via alexa or the app.
1067,All Around Great Humidifier!,I originally bought this humidifier for my indoor plants that are in my bedroom but now I have fallen in love with it for myself personally. I have allergies and my throat and nose are always dry in the morning. I no longer have that issue. I absolutely love the scheduling on and off feature!
1068,"Be careful, they will spam you when you if you set up the ""smart"" features","Amazon guidelines note: This is a relevant product review and should not be removed, it is not a criticism of the seller. You must register your email for this product to function properly, then they start spamming you.

I just wanted a humidifier. Turns out, when you set up an account for the smart functionality to work, they take the opportunity to add you to mailing lists without asking you to opt in. Their app has no section to opt in or manage such emails. I have now received several different spam emails.  One had no unsubscribe link at all, and I told them if they send me any more I would leave negative feedback on Amazon. Well, I received 2 more spams from separate email lists that each required a separate unsubscribe process. So here we are, they are getting the well deserved negative and this is a warning to others to watch out."
1069,Easy to use,High tech and easy to use very quiet
1070,"Good buy, possibly best...","I love this thing.  I bought it for plants in a grow tent, and it worked so well for that I bought another to humidify my room.  It works wonderfully."
1071,Couldn¡¯t Connect to Wifi,"I tried to get the humidifier to connect to wifi through the app and it did not work. I moved it right next to the router as the app suggested to move it closer after the connection failed, however that did not help either. It would load and get to 80% and then give a connection failed message. I got it to connect to the wifi once, and even added it to my Google home and it was working. Then I moved the humidifier closer to my plants because that¡¯s where I want it to be and then the device was offline. I kept trying to have it connect and nothing. I then moved it next to the router again and it still would not connect. The device itself functions well from the few hours I have had it, however I cannot make any adjustment if it does not connect to the wifi because it is ¡°offline¡± in the app. I removed the device from the app as well and tried to set everything up again and that did not work either. I am using the 2.5 GB required wifi as well."
1072,Impressed,I'm blown away by this unit after about an hour of use. The best features are definitely the vesync app connectivity (I know some people don't like it or have a hard time using it  but I have smart outlets that use it and have had it for years) and the top load feature. The humidistat is also a nice touch but I doubt it's super accurate. I'd recommend it and may buy another.
1073,Leaks!,We have to put a tray under it because it always leaks. Very frustrating!
1074,Great for allergies,I had a Dyson humidifier and I was worried about trying a cheaper brand but I am so glad I did. So quiet and way easier to clean. And a huge plus to be able to control it with my phone. I bought a second one within a month after since it was so awesome. No light at night either so it doesn't disrupt my sleep at all. Normally the noise gets to me at night but this was a very soothing sound and not very loud at all. Love the digital read of the humidity level too.
1075,Like the 3 levels of intensity,I didn't get a remote with my humidifier.  I turn it on using the buttons on the machine.
1076,WiFi control does not work,"WiFi control can barely work. Tried reboot and register multiple times, but app always shows the device is offline."
1077,it works,It works great and the company stand by there product
1078,Leaked everywhere,"This product worked for less than 1 month and literally 1 week after my return window closed, it leaked EVERYWHERE. No matter what I do, there¡¯s a piece that opens and leaks the water all over the floor. If tech support doesn¡¯t help with this issue, I¡¯m leaving my review up because this wasn¡¯t cheap."
1079,Works wonders,"Not bad but I find mine leaving a white powder residue over everything nearby. Not sure what it is, I shall do some research and update in time. Overall it keeps the humidity under control.

Edit: the white residue or mineral deposits from my tap water. If you don¡¯t want that you will have to buy distilled water."
1080,Love it!,Works great! Very helpful! Perfect for my daughter¡¯s room! Easy to set up.
1081,Love this product,"The only problem with this product is I can not use it in the bedroom, will connect to the router with Bluetooth."
1082,Puts out the moisture for sure,I really like this unit. The only thing I have to say is for some reason it will turn itself off completely so I have to turn it back on. Not sure why. On auto it will shut down but main unit is on until humidity reaches desired moisture. But it just turns itself off completely. No lights on.
1083,Love it but cant get replacement parts,"I have been looking for a humidifier that wasnt an odd shape or super ugly.  This is it.  I love the mist, I live the aromatherapy tray, I love the night light, I love being able to turn all the lights off at night.  My boyfriend thinks this is his humidifier.  Ill be purchasing another.

EDIT: my friend dropped the bottom half of my work humidifier when moving and the ¡°float¡± cane out and a nub that keeps it in broke off.  this part is easy to remove anyways and is small enough.  Sadly, when I inquired about a replacement that I was fully willing to pay for, I was told they are not offering replacement parts and Id need to purchase a whole new unit.  This is so wasteful on a lot of levels.  Sadly, I will not be purchasing anything else from this company until they start valuing customers money and the planet."
1084,Just what I needed,"This is exactly what I needed for my daughters nursery
We have radiator heat so it gets very dry very quick

I honestly am about to order 3 more for the other bedrooms in our home!!"
1085,Wow! I ended up buying 4 of them!,"This humidifier is amazing! I live in Colorado so we are dry, pretty much all the time. I have tried countless humidifiers and I never liked any of them. I decided to try this one and I'm so glad I did! The features in the app are great! I love the smart scene features where it will auto turn on/ shut off when it gets to a certain humidity threshold. I just realized today that the app sends a push notification to my Apple watch to let me know the water in the tank is empty and when the tank has been lifted. I remember reading a couple reviews saying they wished it told them when the tank was empty. That must be a new feature and thank you developers for listening! A good signing that they are still improving their tech on an existing product!

Another thing I absolutely love is that I can have it turn on and shut off at specific times, thus not wasting water and energy. Example: I have a schedule set to not run the humidifier in my bedroom from 7am-7pm and to turn on from 7pm-7am and not to get above 47% humidity or below 42%.

Then again to not run in our living room/basement/etc when we are sleeping! Amazing!

One slight con and it's not even really a con. From other reviews others have said the humidity % is off on the display. Well, yes, it's slightly off, but that's because it's right next to the humidifier.  I have a digital hygrometer by goove that builds a beautiful chart of my temps and humidity throughout the day (this one for you other tech loving people: ( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Y36FWTT/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_GR4CHFVSDT6XZGQAGG73?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1 ), that I have on the otherside of the room where I have each humidifier, there is about a 5% difference. Not a big deal and no stars reduced because in the app you can adjust your humidity threshold to 5% higher.

Example: Humidifier shows it's 45% humidity but the hygrometer across the room is 42%, I go in the app and adjust my auto shut off to 48%."
1086,What's not to love?,"I am someone who needs a humidifier to sleep all year round.  I'm very sensitive to dry air so having a humidifier is a requirement for me. I've had many humidifiers over the years, however words cannot express my happiness with this product! It literally puts all of the others to shame. I walk pass it and just smile.

Pro's - Quiet, top filling, large capacity, steady streams of mist, Alexa or App control, attractive, has compartment for essential oil."
1087,Didnt work,"The machine would shut off after only a few minutes
So frustrating"
1088,Junk,This doesn't like to stay connected and is constantly disconnecting and shutting off
1089,I love it!,I¡¯m not sure if this cool mist humidifier is working to relieve my dry air but it¡¯s an awesome product.  Very quiet and reliable.  Puts out a lot of mist and automatically shuts off when out of water.
1090,Very Good Item,"Good Item, Does as we need."
1091,Best humidifier,"This is a great improvement over my last humidifier.  It's quiet, it will automatically shut off when it reaches a set point so it doesn't over humidify the air, and cleaning it uses the distilled vinegar you can buy anywhere.  Because it automatically shuts off, the savings in distilled water is substantial."
1092,Stopping working after two use,This is the worst product I've ever bought.
1093,Did not work from day 1!!!!,Did not work from day 1! Not eligible for return or refund!!! Dollar Tree has better return policies that that!!! I am beyond furious about this!!!!
1094,Quiet and powerful,"I love this humidifier. It's a perfect size to fit on a side table, it's nearly silent and it puts out a ton of mist. I bought this to use in my tropical plant room and it brings the room up to 70-75% humidity easily. A full water tank will run for almost 48 straight hours. It's super easy to fill and clean. I've only been using it for a few days but thus far I am impressed"
1095,A real powerhouse!,This really puts out alot of cool mist.  Perfect for our large bedroom. I use it on the medium setting and it goes thru 1/2 gal every night! Really helps my dry eyes and nose!
1096,Leaks.,Flooded my floors twice. No idea how - it¡¯s like it gets too much water inside the main part and just all leaks out afterwards. I suggest you empty the water before adding new water.
1097,Doesn¡¯t turn on,"I ordered my humidifier and it doesn¡¯t power on. The outlet has power and when I plug it in the humidifier briefly lights up, but when I hit the power button nothing happens. I will be returning it."
1098,The humidifier float doesn¡¯t work correctly do not buy,"This humidifier has issues with the float, it doesn¡¯t lift the valve to allow water to fill lower tank I¡¯ve had 1 week and have been dealing with the issue"
1099,whisper quiet!,"Very pleased with this unit; is humidifying a room of about 100 SF with three large windows, and is keeping it at 65% for my rare tropical plant collection."
1100,Great humidifier,I¡¯m a lash artist and this is perfect for adjusting my humidity in my work environment!
1101,10/10,"So far I¡¯ve been using it about 2 weeks & love it.. easy to setup, easy to clean, easy to put water plus easy access to control from my phone.. literally doesn¡¯t make any noise & the night light feature & timer come in handy.."
1102,Excellent!!,This is exactly what I hoped it would be! I bought 2 for 2 large rooms. In just a few short minutes I had both humidifiers connected to my phone and running. Very customizable with a lot of options. The app is very well designed and allows me to control all of the aspects of the humidifiers in an easy to use interface. Cleaning is vey simple with only one small area that is a bit difficult for a standard dish brush to scrub clean. Overall I found this to be a perfect solution for humidifying a couple rooms.
1103,I bought 2 of these for our move to a drier area,"We recently moved from a relatively humid area to an area that is much drier, so I bought two of these for use in our bedrooms to help the transition.

Pro
-  Easy to fill.  Just lift off the water container and carry to the sink, fills from the top.  It can drip if it was not entirely empty.
- Lasts for several days.  Even living somewhere where it is running for 6-8 hours a day I only need to refill every 3-4 days.
- Lets out a nice mist that can be directed.  I have it fall right onto my face while I sleep.
- The ability to schedule on/off times using the wifi is nice.  I have it scheduled to turn on around the time I go to bed and turn off in the morning without my having to do anything.

Con (none of which are all that bad)
- The essential oil option is isn't great.
  - It is very subtle.  I liberally apply oils to the pad and I don't smell them unless I literally stick my face directly into the mist.
  - I've noticed a film of oil collects on top of the unit and on the nearby surfaces.
  - The essential oil plug is on the back of the unit, which can make reaching it a little awkward.
- It does make the air feel noticeably cooler and I will often feel a 'draft' in the middle of the night and realize it is the unit turning on.  This isn't bad, but may disturb those sensitive to drafts.

Note, I also purchased small drop-ins that control mold and mildew.  I recommend the same.  The mold/mildew buildup has been minimal."
1104,Great Smart Humidifier!,"I purchased a few of these to have in each of our bedrooms during the winter months, and so far they have been great! The setup was super easy, I love the smart app and ability to set a schedule (we only have it turn on at night while sleeping, and it's set up to only operate as needed based on the humidity levels in each room). Super convenient, and so far the results have definitely been noticeable. I don't wake up with dry, sore sinuses or throat, even when the heat kicks on (we have a gas furnace). Definitely worth the price!

By the way - we've had these for roughly 2 weeks, and none of the basins have had to be refilled. In fact, they aren't even halfway empty yet!"
1105,lasted 5 months and stopped working. No customer support available. Buyer Beware,"Noise level, sleep mode, and easy cleaning I gave 4 stars, but the product stop working after only 5 months. Hardly worth paying $80."
1106,"Needs WiFi, not just Bluetooth","Will not work wirelessly unless you have wireless internet 2.4ghz only, will not work with 5ghz. It will not work with Hughes net WiFi/router at all. If power goes out humidifier does not turn back on. The wireless/power button needs pressed every time it shuts off to reconnect. It does have the option to preset humidity levels, but ONLY through wireless app. If I were using it someplace convenient then I may have better opinion. The app/wireless settings should be part of the manually operated buttons/settings on the machineÿ. Also, after having for a little while I noticed that in needs be filled almost daily. I would buy one with higher capacity next time. I would only recommend if it was for someplace very convenient."
1107,"Let them be peeping toms, or it won't work.","The Auto mode holds the humidity at 40-50%.  I want to change it to hold the humidity closer to 50%.  In order to make this happen, I MUST...

1 - Install some un-trusted app on my PHONE with all my data.
2 - Sign up for an internet account.
3 - Give them whatever personal information they ask for.
4 - Give the app what ever phone permissions it asks for.
5 - ...and I'm assuming, give them network access for the remote functionality to work.

What?  Do you take me for a Rube?
I want Federal Legislation attached to right to repair, to make this sort of practice a violation of federal law.

This thing is a Peloton Bike.  They are both going in the trash, I'll buy something else at brick and mortar."
1108,Good product,"Love it, big water capacity!"
1109,"A smart humidifier, is it worth it?","I bought this unit to be able to adjust humidity levels even when I'm not home. And so far it has been able to do that very well. You are able to adjust the RH level to within a 5% threshold. Meaning if you set it to 60, it will pump the humidity to 65 and wait for it to drop to 55 before it kicks in again.

Pros:
-Big water tank that will last for days or weeks depending on your situation.
-Remote capabilities allowing you to control this unit if you're not home.
-Disable all LEDs, to not disturb your loved ones.

Cons:
-The app tends to crash all the time running on an android. Have not tested on iOS."
1110,SENSOR and AUTO DOESN'T WORK,I'll give it this...it does humidify....sensor and auto mode DO NOT work at all though. I have a few different humidly readers bc I'm a weirdo and the built it in sensor is drastically off by 10%+ at all times. It looks like it's guessing just random numbers which of course causes the auto setting to be completely useless
1111,"Good units, easy to fill.",Haven¡¯t had them long enough to know all the ins and outs but they¡¯re working  as expected. Maybe one day we¡¯ll get around to utilizing all the bells and whistles...
1112,Requires datamining app to change auto humidity level,"Ridiculous they force you to install an app just to change the auto humidity level. The app asks for permission to access contacts, camera, phone, pictures, call logs, etc...  Its crazy intrusive. An app should provide convenience for an appliance, nit be required for normal functions. I have no idea who needs air purifiers and humidifiers on an app but I sure as hell dont. I do need one where I can set automatic humidity but there's no way I'm going to use this datamining app, so this thing is useless to me."
1113,Item doesn't work,"Unfortunately, the item keeps shutting off randomly saying there is no water left, even though there is water. But with no returns allowed on this item, looks like I'm out."
1114,Broken? Probably not.,"I had some trouble at first getting it set up. It sat on the counter for 7 days before I figured out you need to take the big blue chunk of styrofoam out of the base. I tried returning it through Amazon but it wouldn¡¯t let me so I called the support number on the box and the guy was so nice and helpful. Now that I got it working I have to say, most quiet humidifier I¡¯ve ever had. I really only bought it because it was blue tooth but I¡¯m really satisfied with everything else. Would definitely recommend."
1115,Love this humidifier!,I use a humidifier to maintain 50% humidity for drying plants.  So far I'm thrilled with this unit.  The ability to check and control the humidity via the app on my phone is a great feature.  It saves me running up and down stairs multiple times a day to check humidity as well as  the water level.  I'm still on the same tank of water after 3 days.  I've gone through several models and this is by far the winner.
1116,Constantly turns off.,It constantly stops humidifying because it says the tank is empty even after I have just filled it. It only runs for like 2 minutes and then shuts off because it thinks it¡¯s empty.
1117,Not impressed,Bought two first time they ran out of water they quit working
1118,Top-fill feature and smartphone app make this the best.,"I looked into many humidifiers, and 2 weeks after purchasing this I am sold that this was absolutely the best decision. It is extremely intuitive. The app couldn't be easier to navigate, and surprisingly well-coded and interfaced as well. Makes it extremely easy to have multiple humidifiers and be in control from anywhere.
It's 100% silent.
The top fill feature is AMAZING; I just grab the tub and refill at the fridge when needed, then just pop it back on the base. It's clean, there's no water spillage, and I did not realize what a flex this feature was. I almost opted for the smaller, more chic looking option -- but it does not fill from the top so it's always a bit of a ""thing"".
I bought 2 more of these, one to replace the bottom-fill one I got and another for the bedroom since the plants love it so much -- I suppose it is good for humans too! Highly, highly recommend this brand and this specific product."
1119,Overall it good,As good as it¡¯s claims but just lack on the easy to clean. It easy to clean tank on the contrary the base takes a good effort to clean properly.
1120,Inaccurate Humidity Sensor,"The item is defective. We have multiple device at home that can show humidity level. Our Nest, as well as our baby monitor both show the room humidity as 50-55%. However, this humidifier sensors 70%, which is far off."
1121,Exactly as advertised!,Works perfect in all aspects that it comes with and is capable of!
1122,Product Started Leaking less than 3 mos after purchase,"I am using filtered water - yet upon start up -it would whine and squeal loudly - then it started leaking,

Do NOT PUCHASE!"
1123,Horrible! Waste of money.. just stops working.,"I bought this model about 2 years ago and loved it.. but after using everyday for almost 2 years (I live in the desert ) it finally stopped being reliable and efficient .. purchased the same brand but different model in black, but found it to be less convenient to fill than this modelÿ so I repurchased this one and first use it was cracked on the bottom and leaking some weird brown stuff (all over my light colored carpet ).. I had that one replaced, and now this new one has stopped working.. I¡¯ve had it running on and off for less than one week. Can¡¯t return this one because I¡¯ve already had to replace it ?!
Obviously the brand has turned to garbage.
So disappointed."
1124,Works perfectly and easily controlled with phone.,"Great wifi humidifier which can notify you when it¡¯s empty. Does last multiple days, but if running fulltime it may need daily refill. Kept a room at 60% humidity for drying herbs. The fact that you can turn on/off the night light and display lcd is a great and thoughtful feature when used in the kids room."
1125,"if it doesn't work, can it still be called smart?","The humidifier can be controlled by your cell phone. Without the cell phone it is hard to adjust the settings of the humidity level. and there are only three levels for manual control. A analog control seems better than this one.

The biggest problem is that the relative humidity meter is ~10% higher than two of my other humidity meters and make it difficult/impossible to be used in automatic mode. Automatic mode will stop producing mist at 53% of RH. So if you want to keep a 45% RH, you cannot do it with this machine."
1126,Works great for what I need,"I needed one to supplement the humidity for my orchids outdoor on a small porch.  I live in the Texas hill country where it¡¯s not super humid and I don¡¯t have a greenhouse.  I have to refill it almost daily on drier days, but it¡¯s working great for my needs.  And the size is perfect as well.  The Bluetooth function is a plus also.  I can see what the humidity level is without going outside to check it manually."
1127,Don¡¯t buy it you cant return it,The Unit in Night mood still has a display and it¡¯s bright
1128,Doesn¡¯t work. Add water sign keeps coming every 5 seconds,"As per attached picture I filled the water tank to top but every time I turn the humidifier on it starts and then turns off within 5 seconds with error sign showing ¡°Add water¡±.
I also tried reducing water level to half in case I may have too much but it did not help.

Waste of time and effort, it¡¯s going back. I would not recommend it to others."
1129,Works as advertised,"Just started using the Levoit humidifier and it is very quiet.  Mist has a long range and the settings are easy to use. Would recommend.
Update: Still working great and quiet. Does not leak at all. I do agree though, the on / off button doesn¡¯t appear to work well.  I have to push the start button and if I see mist I know it¡¯s on. If I push the mist button and it doesn¡¯t go on then I know it¡¯s off.  Still will use for the mist level and quiet operation."
1130,Buttons Don't Work,I have to sit and push and push and keep working at it to get it to turn on. The buttons do not work.
1131,Got it today and it¡¯s not working!!,Got it today and I can not turn it on. It¡¯s not working and I can not return it!!!
1132,it is true that is a lot of water comes out and makes the floor very wet,I need to know before buying this humidifier if it is true that a lot of water comes out and makes the floor very wet. Thank you
1133,Bad quality water container cracked and leaking water,Bad quality water container cracked and leaking water
1134,Perfect!,"It is silent!! So easy to clean! Not too big and does the job. My plants are way happier with the consistent moisture and my son stopped getting nose bleeds at night. Comparatively very affordable, easy to use, and turns off on it's own when it's empty. I would recommend."
1135,Bad experience,"It is very difficult to properly clean this cause there are crevices that you cannot reach reasonably. The WiFi will occasionally stop working which was annoying. Auto mode allows you to set a desired humidity level but will only turn on once your humidity dips below 5% of your desired level. Then once it¡¯s on, it will go until it reaches 5% above your desired level. So that¡¯s a 10% variance which was very annoying when I tried to use it. Good concept though but the threshold should be less than 5%. The top load was convenient for refilling and it was pretty quiet. Overall though, I don¡¯t recommend buying this. I stopped using my unit after 6 months cause of the annoyances"
1136,I want this to work so badly!!,"I have had two of these. The first made a high pitched noise so I got a replacement sent. The second doesn't make the noise however, it constantly shuts off saying that it's empty when it's not. So frustrating! Especially because this would be the perfect humidifier if only it worked properly. Maybe I just got unlucky but I don't feel like trying again a third time."
1137,"Strong vapor stream, great price","I love that it's quiet.  It's easy to fill, puts out a strong stream of vapor, easy to fill and does the job well"
1138,Very good addition to your room,It¡¯s a nice humidifier comparing tot the others that I have the instruction was pretty straight forward and it holds lot of item giving it a few more day till I give final conclusion but so far it¡¯s done it¡¯s job
1139,Works great!,Just got it. So far so good. Quiet and easy set up.
1140,Exactly what I wanted,"I had a Levoit that I liked, but it was smaller and was a bottom fill. I wanted to stick to Levoit brand, but wanted a larger one that was a top fill. This is exactly what I wanted, and it still has the smart option."
1141,no no no no no, SO HARD TO TURN ON SO HARD TO TURN OFF. Like it works GREAT when it works. But getting it to work IS SO HARD
1142,Humidifier,"This humidifier replaces a model with an interior metal ring that became pitted. My new humidifier surpasses all previous models we¡¯ve purchased. It displays the current humidity level in the room, you can select your ideal humidity range setting, has 2 night light settings, etc.  Highly recommend this one."
1143,when setting the humidity levels via app still does not turn off,"when setting the humidity levels via app still does not turn off, still runs after hitting humidity level set to auto, still have to turn it off and on completely useless feature if i still have to control when on or off.

EDIT: figured out how to get it to work properly app must at least remain running in background on phone to work properly. still a slight disappointment but overall product works well."
1144,Easy set up,Just got 4 of these so I hope they last. Seem pretty high quality and sturdy but cant say much about the internals yet. I have to say the wifi set up was amazing. I buy lots of smart home devices and these were by far the easiest to set up. Excellent app.
1145,Tried alot of humidifers... this one rocks!,Easy setup. Easy app connectivity as well. Directons are well written. Humidifier is only adjustable through the app FYI. If that doesnt bother you then buy this. I noticed a difference right away unlike other cheaper models and brands. works as it should. Buying a second one for our other bedroom.
1146,"Cool concept, but has flaws","The humidifier worked great the first 3 weeks. Week 4 and on, I've been dealing with an issue where the app tells me ""Humidifier is empty"" but it is not empty!!!!!!!!! I can clearly see that the humidifier is full. It stops operating when it gives me this notification so I've been battling with it since then. I tried cleaning it out and still get the prompt. I recommend to stick with a simple humidifier because when adding all these cool tech features something as simple as a bad sensor can ruin the entire operation. I would not recommend this humidifier."
1147,Great product and so quiet!,Great humidifier. So quiet!! Ability to control through the app is great.
1148,Excellent humidifier for large room.,"Humidifier working very.  It is quiet, easy to fill and is good for a large room."
1149,Emits a high pitched noise when on!,It mostly works as it should. But the high pitched noise makes it unbearable to use at night.
1150,This is an amazing product for the price!,Absolutely best product of its type in market. Highly recommend buying this.
1151,LOVE this,"I have had several humidifiers and this by far is the best. I love the size of the tank I don¡¯t have to read it every day or even every other day. It is beyond quiet. The top fill is amazing I don¡¯t have to remove the entire tank. The only problem is the buttons are all digital and it did not come with a manual.  There¡¯s a few things on there I¡¯m not sure what they mean.

update10/17/21  I am not able to use the pad on the front very easily - none of the setting stay.
Alexa is hooked up but without some direction this has been slightly difficult to figure out.  It did not come with instruction manual, the pads for oils, adn I am slightly more irritated now than before.  I am considering send this back if I am not able to use the phone app thourgh Alexia to change the setings easily."
1152,Plant love it,"Item recieved works is as advertised. No damage on the item, and is in pristine condition. Can hold a large amount of water. Able to auto set max 8% humidity before rest via Bluetooth. Plants thrives with this item. Humidifier is quite and its modern look doesn't make it look like an eyesore."
1153,Works great!,Love that I can fill it from the top. Seems to last a lot longer than my last cheap vicks humidifier I had. Very quiet. I use it in my two year olds bedroom when he¡¯s sick. I¡¯ve noticed that when he¡¯s sick and we have it on he ends up turning his body to the complete opposite side of the bed just to get closer to it. Not sure if it coincidental or not though..
1154,Ease of use,Excellent humidifier.  We bought 2 and they work great.
1155,Keep clean and dump water every day,Works expected and helps me sleep better
1156,Awesome!,This humidifier comes with an app. It¡¯s easy to use and the app is easy to navigate. I set it and forget it. Humidifier fits well in my 5x5 and my girls love it!
1157,As advertized,"This product is worth buying, it's easy to use and works very well."
1158,The Best Humidifier,"I've tried my share of humidifiers since living in Arizona and then back to Sacramento.  This unit is so quiet you can't tell if it's on other than seeing the mist coming out of the top of it.  It's easy to fill with water, easy to clean.  And you can use scented oils, if you want.  This one is the one that does it for me!"
1159,"Quiet, accurate humidity control",This unit is well-designed and built; easy to operate using front panel controls.  Using in 'auto' mode does a good job of controlling the room (a bedroom) humidity at a comfortable 45% level.  QUIET operation makes is just great for using while one is sleeping.  2 thumbs up!
1160,So far so good!,"Had this several weeks now, absolutely love it. I make sure to use distilled water."
1161,It¡¯s okÿ..,I feel like for a levoit this should be better. Not impressed
1162,Llego r¨¢pido f¨¢cil de instalar," Lo tengo en med y tira fuerte,no ruido f¨¢cil de controlar y limpiar"
1163,Excellent surprise,"I ordered this. Humidifier as my current one needed to be replaced after seven years of use. Surprised because this new one is so quiet you cannot even tell it is on. That, and I didn't realize it was Bluetooth accessible with an app, which is terrific! I was able to set it up in under 5 minutes and get it running. My only issue is the need to use distilled water. Also, no filter in the event I use purified water instead. Beyond these two minor points, this is a great appliance."
1164,Best Humidifier I¡¯ve Ever Had,"Reason I bought this was because of the easy to clean, large opening.  I¡¯ve been searching for an easy to clean humidifier for years. I¡¯m sick of slimy deposits in hard to clean spaces on my old one!

This one is so quiet, even say it¡¯s silent!  It gives off a good amount of moisture too.  Settings are great overall, except the sleep mode can only be with the auto setting which does not read correctly so it doesn¡¯t run at night as much as I¡¯d like it too.  So I don¡¯t use sleep mode and know the light display will be bright.

Overall, this is a big winner!!! Already planning to buy another one fir my daughter¡¯s room."
1165,Great product!,"I had major sinus reconstruction surgery and the surgeon told me to purchase a cool mist humidifier to help with my recovery. After much research I decided to give this product a try.  I am so happy I decided on this item for the following reasons:

* Holds a large amount of water so we do not need to fill it as often.  We run this 24-7 and it is operating flawlessly and making a huge difference in making my nose and throat not dried out.
* Easy to clean
* Does NOT leak
* User friendly
* Puts out a large amount of steady mist
* You can adjust the direction of the mist
* Works great in a large space
* Easy to move to a different location
* We live in California where it is hot and dry.  With this product running, we can feel a difference in the air.  No longer feels dry and stuffy. We plan to use this daily, even after I have completely recovered from the sinus surgery.

GREAT PRODUCT, WORTH EVERY DOLLAR!"
1166,Great humidifier,"Super easy to use. The phone app is also easy to use and is actually easier to use to set up the humidifier than the on-screen buttons. It does a very good job of keeping the room at the desired humidity level, and is actually very efficient with the water. I've never used an entire tanks worth of water in the amount of time before I have to empty it and clean it. Speaking of cleaning, it's really nice to have the tank with a lid on the top, because it's really easy to get in there and clean. My other humidifier is a bottom feeding humidifier, and it's a paint clean."
1167,Humidifier for great!,Works great and I sleep comfortably
1168,Loved it !,"Just as described, loved it great price for value"
1169,Very quiet!,Just received this today.We had to return another brand because the noise  kept us up all night.I love this humidifier. There is absolutely no noise! The night light & sleep features are really nice.The mist started right away & is very strong on the high settings.
1170,Love the humidifier,"Like all the features. The phone app. The cleaning is easy., night light."
1171,One of my favorite products!!!!!!!!,I am obsessed. It helps with my husband and babies breathing. ABSOLUTELY NO NOISES!!!!
1172,Great product that is incredibly quiet,"This device is great. The humistat turns it off when the humidity threshold is reached which is wonderful because it means that the tank will last for quite a while. The only downside is that the app has some connectivity issues, but it's a minor inconvenience and this device is still five stars."
1173,It was easy to operate,It was more than expected.
1174,Dosent runn all night,Did well on first fill then it doesn't run all night just for a short time
1175,It works great,Good seller
1176,Great humidifier,So far its a great machine. Helps me breath better in this dry town where i live.
1177,Works greatÿ when it actually works,My device always goes off line when I power it off and power it back on. Cannot seem to turn WiFi back on without having to go into a pairing mode. Only way to get it working over WiFi again is to pair and add the device again from scratch.
1178,Great humidifier,"I really love this humidifier for my plant babies, and they love it too. I didn't know i can connect my cell phone to it...shame on me for not reading the manual."
1179,Great for a greenhouse cabinet,I bought other humidifiers for my IKEA Greenhouse cabinet and they didn¡¯t work at all. They were inconsistent and had inaccurate humidistats. This was worth the money. It keeps everything at the humidity level that I need it at consistently. The app is cool too and shares lots of valuable info.
1180,Absolutely Worth It!,"We've noticed such a difference since we started using the levoit humidifier! The machine is ultra quiet, turns off automatically if you forget to refill, has a trust app, and the cool steam means we don't have to worry about kids or pets shoving their face into it.  Cleaning is a breeze, which is what drew us to this model - and now we have 2!"
1181,Absolutely love!,This is perfect in my bedroom!!! It is very quiet. I love you can change how much mist it puts out. Best part is you can top fill it or take it off the base and fill up in sink. Very easy to use.
1182,"5 weeks, then sprung a leak.","It started leaking at the bottom after 5 weeks. How hard is it to make a humidifier that doesn't spring a leak. Fyi, don't buy used goods from Amazon, especially if the price difference is less than 20%. Will the manufacturer honor the original warranty??"
1183,Convenient to use room humidifier,"I¡¯ll start by saying that I use a room humidifier to keep my guitar and mandolin collection happy. This is my third humidifier and there are definitely differences. My first one was a levity but you had to remove the tank and fill it in the bathtub which was a pain. This model is a top fill and it¡¯s very convenient. Once you do the initial tank fill with the tank off, you can replenish the water from the topÿ..very convenient.

Yes, this type of humidifier does leave a white dust that collects on everything, a real pain when it gets on my guitars. A little trick I tried which seems to be working is to buy a cheap Brita water pitcher. It takes out most of the impurities which is what most of the dust consists of. It¡¯s a little more work but I don¡¯t have to buy gallons of distilled water. My last humidifier lasted 3 years so hopefully this one will give me similar service."
1184,Stopped working after a month,Most stopped working and I¡¯ve only had it for a month!
1185,Does what I expected and is easy to fill and clean,The night mode is difficult to understand
1186,Keeps shutting off,"I bought this humidifier for the auto setting that keeps the room at your desired humidity level. Unfortunately, that setting does not work very well as the humidifier keeps turning off on it¡¯s own and not turning back on when the humidity drops. I have it set to 65% for my tropical plants and today it got down to 45% and never turned on. I¡¯ve tried putting it in manual mode so that it doesn¡¯t auto shut off but it will still turn off on it¡¯s own after some time. I can¡¯t figure out how to keep it running consistently and it¡¯s very frustrating. It stays on for about 10-20 minutes and then just shuts itself off so I have to keep turning it back on."
1187,"Looks nice, works great.","Previous humidifier that had to be filled from the bottom. What a pain.
This one makes for easy refills (top-filled) works as expected, and it looks really nice. My only gripe is that i don't see a way to set the target humidity without using the app. Meh. I'll live :)"
1188,Good for hot weather.,Need to cool the room when hot weather here in Las Vegas.
1189,Leaks all over after 3 weeks,Leaks all over after 3 weeks. The float valve seems to be the culprit. Does not pair with google onhub. Returning..
1190,Amazing and Quitet,"I have had 2 other humidifiers over the past 6 or so years and this is the best.  The first made gurgling noises during the night, and the second one leaked, and the lights wouldn't shut off.  This one is noise-free, yes, you don't hear a thing, easy to fill and all the lights go out to make it for a dark night's sleep!"
1191,"Buttons awkward, leaves everything g around it soaking wet","This is fine if you love to place towels all around it. It spits a ton of water in droplets are not exactly mistÿ the buttons are weird & it is hard to know if you pushed them or not. The light is way toooooo bright. We have two different brands also that are way better than this one. It works but is more like a lawn sprinkler than a humidifier. Also, this one does not seem to spray the mist into the air with as much force (maybe the fan is weak?) as the other ones we have so it barely gets past the machine and does not go more than few inches above the machine."
1192,Love it!,"Has been working great! Completely silent, pumps out mist.  Easy to refill.  I like that I can turn the mist in different directions to get different plants.  Runs for almost 3 days on medium."
1193,High Pitched Electric noise when running,"Was very hopeful for this unit. Product puts out a decent amount of vapor, but has a high pitch electric sound that makes it impossible to sleep. I¡¯ve tried moving it away from my bed but the noise still bounces around my bedroom. If you are a light sleeper this product will annoy you."
1194,Came cracked,"I really like this item, but it came with the water-holding plastic bit cracked and leaks water. If I could get just the top plastic water bit I wouldn't return it."
1195,Wish it has more manual control on the front panel,"So far so good. It is nice to be able to control via app but sometimes having the manual control right on the unit is very useful and convenient.
Great to able to fill from the top but nervous if the kids may accidentally bump onto it and make a big mess.
I guess I need to see a bit longer if any leak complaints as in a few of the reviews."
1196,Amazing and game changer,"1) being able to fill from the top a game changer from our former lift out, flip upside down, leak all over the place, and heavily try to replace. In our three months of usage have probably paid for the unit in saved distilled water. Having it monitor humidity is amazing- from our old dumb humidifier which needed a bottle of distilled water a day it is more once a month now. Alexa integration perfect! Can¡¯t say enough positives about this unit."
1197,Broke 3 months after use,Broke one month after the return policy expired and they wouldn¡¯t return or replace it. I just wanted a replacement but they won¡¯t do it even though I¡¯ve owned this 3 months. I have four of these and this is the only one that¡¯s broken. I need to buy 3 more but I will no longer be purchasing anymore humidifiers from this company since they refuse to replace a defective product.
1198,The app makes this humidifier incredibly easy to operate,"I bought this humidifier for my plants. I appreciate the large tank, as I only need to refill it every4th -5th day in the summer. The noise level is fine (you can hear a high pitch sound when it's on, but I am OK with that). The app and the large tank makes this a very low maintenance humidifier. I recognize this is on the pricier end, which can be a deciding factor for most. We bought a ""Like New"" unit, which made the steep price tag a non-issue. Recommended."
1199,Quality,Great product dependable
1200,Leaks!,"I loved this humidifier for about 2 months and so did my plants. The smart features are great and I kept it on auto 24/7, I also cleaned it once a week. But unfortunately like some other customers I came home the other night to it leaking water everywhere.
I also have a Levoit Air Purifier that I love!"
1201,works good but,needs to have some air circulation for it to properly cover 500sq ft. if you set it to 50% it will be 50% right next to it but move a hydrometer 6 ft away and it drops to 40% if you dont have good air circulation it wont bring a whole room to a specific %.  best to run a small fan near it or have some kind of air movment.
1202,Returned,"Had to return. The power button was useless, I¡¯d press it and nothing would happen. I had to use the app to turn it on.

Then it started saying add water, even when it was full. I would clean it and change the water and still, wouldn¡¯t work. Disappointed but I found a different one from another brand that works for my needs"
1203,Good product,Easy to fill & visualize water remaining. Auto shut off. Can tell Alexa to turn off & on
1204,Its removable you can bring the tank to the water or the water to the tank.,It's smart so it can be programmed if you need to protect products that need more moisture for their overall function this is for you
1205,Looks like it is going to be TRASH!(Update),"I have had this humidifier for a few days now, and so here is my problem. How is it when you have this in a grow tent that is a 36x36x72 to keep humidity at a set % and the humidifier shows that set humidity, but your two humidity gages are reading a totally different % and it is definitely way out of the ¡À 5%.  Example 1 gage reads 38% and the other is reading at 43% and the humidifier is set at 60% give or take ¡À5%... so is it Broke or just straight TRASH? Guess we will see what the company wants to do about fixing this issues with me or not. Photos coming tomorrow. Lights out now, so have to wait.

So, after reaching out to customer service about my issue with their humidifier, the company issued a complete replacement the next day. Thank you. This one works just as described!"
1206,It is out shot off, Use it 24/7 it gives nose mist...just perfect.
1207,Easy to install and use,"Works great . The noise level is quiet . Works great with Alexa , and you can also even put essential oils in it to make the room smell good and help you relax"
1208,Plant and family favorite,My plants and my family love this humidifier! I especially love the easy top fill and how I can control it from my phone!
1209,Warning Dont Listen to All the Articles Promoting This Product....Pure Garbage,"Poor design. Worked for a couple days then continually leaked everywhere. Ive tried several humidifiers ranging in price from 30$ to 80$, this was the most expensive Ive tried and by far the worst."
1210,So far so good,"I bought this one for my plants and love it. The coolest part is that you can control your humidifier with your phone. Also you can schedule certain time for your plants for for your place.
Very quiet, easy to use, and easy to clean!"
1211,Update,"Update:
After i did some online research it came up that the air quality changes, cost by the humidifier are not harmful.
The device is amazing. Extremely user friendly.

Honestly, im not sure how to comment on this. Its worm great-integrates with Alexa for no time, app works amazing, its not loud-(almost) perfection. The thing that is really bothering  me is that every time I turn it on my Dyson Air Purifier indicates higher (not safe) levels of PM2.5 and PM10 with tab or destinated water, which means that this humidifier lowers my air quality. I love the machine but i will be returning it."
1212,Good for the price,"Surprised how well this one works. I've ordered 3 humidifiers from Amazon now, the 1st worked well for a couple months then quit completely. The second never arrived and this one is a vat improvement from the others. Love the light up display and the top fill. Very quiet you won't even notice its there"
1213,Exceeding expectations,I bought this to put nest plants. It has exceeded my expectations! Filling up the water container was very easy with the entire top coming off. The app was easy to use. You can add multiple devices in the app as well.
1214,Won't connect to the app.,"Overall a decent product, but I've tried everything and it simply will not connect via Bluetooth to the app. I was hoping to use voice control with Alexa,but nope."
1215,Great affection, Perfect fit for home
1216,So great I have 3. :D,"Got one, then two, now I have three. Great brand. App is nice, too. :)"
1217,Best product I have bought ever,"The product itself is amazing, has a lot of features that have easy access via the app and voice commands as well.
What's outstanding about this is the customer support, I have never dealt with better ones they made it easy to fix my problem in no time, I would give it ten stars it it was just for customer service.
It is completely noiseless, you can use essential oils, and the scent is steadily diffused through out the night."
1218,Plenty of Adjustable Mist,The large water tank and adjustable mist works perfectly in our open floor plan living area.
1219,Great for the price,"Got this mainly for my houseplants but also to help with my sinuses at night. I just got it so don't have any long term experience but I'm thrilled with it so far. Super quiet, easy to use and setup. The app controls work well. It holds plenty of water so it doesn't need to be filled daily. Filling out a quick form online gets you an extra year of warranty so you get 2 years worth. Looks sleek unlike some other humidifiers. Very happy with it as of right now, will update in the future if that changes."
1220,The best humidifier for a bedroom,"This humidifier is awesome.  I set it to keep a certain humidity level, no night light, and sleep mode.  It tells me when I need to clean it, and when it is out of water (you can turn those off).  Quite easy to clean too.  The water will last one to a few days depending on the humidity level you have it set to, the runtime, how the humidity is in the house overall, etc.  In the winter, it goes at least three days before I need to fill it.  In the summer, it goes between 1-2 days depending on if we have some thunderstorms or not.  I never hear it at night when I am trying to sleep.  The only time I know it is running is when I see it coming out of the nozzle."
1221,No Complaints,"Great, super easy to clean and quiet. No complaints so far."
1222,Lasted 2 months,"used it on and off for two months and the fan stopped working. Support phones tell you they are understaffed and ask you to email customer support. Customer support wants videos of defects and what not instead of just honoring the warranty.
The Humidifier sensor is bad quality and gets stuck on 90% regularly so the app it comes with is pretty much useless. You are better off just getting something cheap with less parts or something better quality all together if automation is what you are looking for."
1223,Just Too Small,"I live in the desert and need to run these units all day to maintain a humidity level of 45% in my bedroom and living area. They're just too small - I have to refill them three times a day. Easy to refill and clean; the interface with my phone is great, but the oil infusing pad is worthless - cannot smell the lemon grass oil I soaked the pads in. These would be fine in small areas (information said 500 sq ft...if you want to refill them 2-3x a day!)"
1224,Great for indoor grow tents!,Lasts forever. The app is great especially for keeping an eye on my plants humidity when I¡¯m not home. I love how it automatically maintains the humidity I set it at. Great for indoor grow tents!
1225,The Buttons are Finicky but Works,When I recieved the item I thought it didn't work. You have to press the buttons gently and they work like touch screen there is no actual pressing of hardware. The thing works great and the low setting is powerful. If you have it on high it'll mistify a 10x10 area within an hour easy (if it's no being vented)
1226,Top fill is so convenient.,"Top fill humidifier is a game changer. I have other two humidifiers are both bottom fill, which always splash water when putting back the water tank. 6L water tank and top fill is perfect for me."
1227,Happy Customer,I really love this brand. I already have 2 air purifiers and recently added this humidifier. I have bad allergies. I immediately can feel the difference in my house. I¡¯m really glad I picked this one. I love the automation features. It puts off way more than I expected.  The different level settings are great and so is the 360 option. LEVOIT did a great job on this one. Happy customer.
1228,Update;,"Update: 10/05/21:
My plants are not in heaven anymore. Humidifier has malfunctioned. It stopped pumping out humidity. Now it¡¯s garbage.

Original review 05/11/21;
 I absolutely LOVE this humidifier! I can control it using my phone or my Alexa products. If you do not have a smartphone, or are not tech savvy I don¡¯t recommend it. You can only adjust the settings through the app!  Otherwise, I 100% recommend this humidifier!"
1229,Levoit Humidifier,"This humidifier is amazing. So quiet, no noise at all. Very effective, my allergies stopped bothering me at night and my snoring got better."
1230,The best humidifier we found!,It's not noisy. Awesome settings like night mode. Easy maintenance. Rec for sure if you need some humidity in your life.
1231,Best humidifier I¡¯ve purchased,I¡¯ve purchased quite a few humidifiers over the years. And can easily say this was the best one I¡¯ve used so far. Defnitely worth the price. App works great too.
1232,,Love it! Only con is that I can not get Alexa to turn it on - she will only turn it off
1233,Great piece I'm of equipment,This is amazing. It connects to my phone and lets me know when it's time for a cleaning. Easy to set up. The light is not too bright and can turn off the display for dark room. It reads the moisture in the air so you don't waste water or get too much water building up on your windows.
1234,Works like a charm,"Quiet, consistent , efficient. Makes our Fl. Home more comfortable at night ."
1235,"So far, so good","I purchased three of these, two for the main floor and one for the basement. Initially, these pumped out mist continuously for several days. Then the house reached a desired point and back to full auto.
The quietness is a selling point. A whole house humidification system would require the heater fan to run all the time. Not a good option for me.
These have been in operation for just short of a month so no long term info yet. Haven't used sleep mode option yet as these are not near the bedroom. But for now, I would give these a buy again recommendation."
1236,Bad products,This one stopped working I have been asking them for a refund no one cares every time I submit a claim the freaking denied it. They are selling bad stuff but you can¡¯t get reimbursed or a replacement or
1237,I WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN,Great humidifier. Runs quiet. Large capacity. And I love the fact that I can control it with Alexa or my smartphone.
1238,Easy and effective,Quiet and effective
1239,Great Product,I love evry feature!
1240,Works!!!,Good works very well!
1241,So Quiet! Love it!,"We couldn't be more pleased with this humidifier! It's pretty dry in AZ and needed something in our bedroom to help us sleep better. Was easy to set up both with the machine and Alexa. Set up a schedule to start every day an hour before we go to bed. It's the quietest humidifier I've ever owned! You can really tell the difference in the air as soon as you enter the bedroom. We do fill it up nightly because it does use 2/3 of the water over night, probably because of the dryness. No leakage so far. Thinking of buying another for the family room!"
1242,Not good quality,Product worked good for a month or so and now I keep getting errors and it won¡¯t work..highly disappointed...would not recommend
1243,"Small, Bluetooth ready, and handles 500 sq ft!!!","Excited to find I can operate this humidifier remotely from my smartphone and has the capacity to humidify a 500 square foot room from its small size and footprint. And, it comes with a two year warranty."
1244,Incredibly efficient humidifier.,"Absolutely love this humidifier. I wasn¡¯t able to get the app to work but didn¡¯t matter! It keeps my apartment between 40-50% humidity without fail. In Southern California, I left the tank to see how long it would last on a full tank and it lasted for a week and a half! Very easy to clean, super quiet it¡¯s unnoticeable, super easy to refill."
1245,Unit powers off,My unit will completely power off by itself. I'm not talking about the automatic smart feature where it hits a certain humidity percentage and stops emitting mist... But the whole unit itself will power off randomly which is terrible. I'm very displeased with this unit. Going to try and contact support to see if they will resolve this matter.
1246,Plants love it. Cats love it. I love it.," Beautiful addition to the home. Very easy to put together and I rarely ever hear it turn on - it¡¯s so quiet! I¡¯ve noticed a huge difference in air quality since purchasing this. The air feels fresher and my skin feels well hydrated! And the plants love it just as much as the cats seem to, too!"
1247,Awesome,Works great and easy to clean
1248,Great for music rooms!,"I've long been controling the humidity in my guitar room by using a ""dumb"" humidifier and two hygrometers, one with a low/high percentage alarm.  The effort in physically monitoring this (even with me being retired and home the majority of most days) results in the relative humidity yo-yoing all over the place, the alarm ocassionally going off at 3 am, and me becoming OCD in constantly having to go to the room to LOOK at the hygrometers, checking everything.
This SMART humidifier solves all that!  I experimented setting the target at 50% (meaning a ten percent swing between 45%-55%) and found the factory default of 45% (meaning 40%-50% swing) is best for my 13' X 10' X 8' ceiling room.
Now I can check on the humidity level and adjust it to suit from anywhere  that has internet.  Plus voice control from anywhere in the house via Google Home!
The 1.7 gallon, top fill tank is a bonus, it is virtually silent in operation, but be aware that the  (somewhat involved) weekly maintenance cleaning ritual on this is the same that one finds for all room humidifiers, so stock up on white vinegar.  If you want it to last, you really do have to follow that schedule fairly closely."
1249,TERRIBLE,This product just quit working. I will never waste my money again.
1250,Only lasted 2 months,"Lasted 2 months, and now won't power up"
1251,Highly recommend,I have returned another humidifier because it burped in the night so I was already skeptical that they all do that. This one is so quiet. You don¡¯t hear a peep. It¡¯s excellent and I like the way it¡¯s easily controlled from the app. Very much would recommend
1252,Works great,It is extremely quite. It does not leave furniture damp.
1253,Diffuser and humidifier in one,"Love that it works with Alexa, it produces a strong steam and that it¡¯s Diffuser and humidifier in one"
1254,Great!!!,It¡¯s really GREAT.  Very happy with the purchase!
1255,love it,nice and quiet
1256,Didn¡¯t work at all,Arrived damaged. While the thing was full of water it kept giving me an error that it was empty. There were no instructions but the description says you just fill and turn on. That¡¯s exactly what I did but it didn¡¯t work so I connected to the app to troubleshoot and plain and simple something about the item was defective. I¡¯ll be returning it today.
1257,Super quiet,"Super quiet, run it with the Vsync app, set the humidity level and it runs by itself.  If this thing lasts it's worth every nickel. It fills from the top which is better than their other earlier model, which fills from the bottom.
So far so good. We'll see in 30 days if it's still working."
1258,My Houseplants Give It Two Green Thumbs Up,"I bought this humidifier for my humidity-loving tropical houseplants and it definitely does the job. Overall, I¡¯m very happy with the purchase but have a couple minor complaints. One, I wish I could set the humidity level using a percentage instead of ¡°low, medium and high.¡± Two, although you can add water through the top, most of the time you still have to take the whole unit to the sink because water collects in the base, under the tank, and you have to empty it. Not a deal breaker, but definitely not as convenient as simply pouring water into the tank to fill. All things considered, I would purchase this again and my plants are all thriving, so I give it two green thumbs up!"
1259,"If you need to regulate humidity, this isn¡¯t for you...","If you¡¯re looking at this because you need to regulate the humidity in a room, this isn¡¯t for you. The equipment itself will give you a bogus reading every single time. I needed this because I have to keep my storage room for roses at 50% so I have many humidistats in the room. They all tell the same reading, yet this humidifier just gives out a random reading that¡¯s not even close. After reading other reviews I feel like the humidistat on this humidifier is completely bogus and just for show."
1260,Fantastic humidifier!,"This product is really great, I love it! Very quiet and let me say I'm super sensitive to noise at night and that was my biggest worry. Also, I was deciding between this one and a newer model that also offered warm mist. However, what sold it for me was the top refill...so easy. Some complained of leakage so I set it on a stainless steel small table versus a dresser but I have not had that issue thank goodness. I also like that I program it to start at 9:00 PM and to stop at 6:00 AM. So I set it and forget it. I can also control it on my phone and set the mist amount. Most importantly, this cured my husband's snoring! I definitely recommend."
1261,Good value,"Works great right out of the box, easy set up for the app too.  You wont regret it.  Will will use a gallon of water on full, depending how dry your area is in about 12 hours"
1262,Amazing humidifier with WiFi smart features,Works great! Love being able to control it via wifi and its ability to turn off all it's light while still being on.
1263,LOOOOVE,I love this thing! Got it for the plants! Never have to wonder if I turned it on. Check in from anywhere. The app is awesome. The cleaning reminders are handy. This is the best humidifier I think I've ever owned! (and it was not the most expensive I've purchased over the years). Eventually I'll get a second one.
1264,Manufacturing defect,"As some other purchasers pointed out, the tank leaks right out of the box. There is no excuse for such poor craftsmanship. Returning the item."
1265,Would not recommend,Liked the product until I realized it was leaving a light white film on my furniture. Couldn't figure out why it was happening until I unplugged the humidifier for the summer and it started to get better. Now it's too late to return it.
1266,Bluetooth stopped working,"Bluetooth phone function stopped working after 1 week, but I otherwise love it."
1267,A very good product...,"This humidifier works very well and is simple to operate.  The directions are not accurate though.  You do not have to hold the power button in for five seconds to start it.  Doing this will create a problem.  Simply touch the power button quickly and it will turn on.  It fills from the top which is a pleasure (unlike my old humidifier) and holds a lot of water, with the option of different speeds, while producing a lot of mist.  It's compatible with my Alexa and shuts itself off when it runs of water.  Maintenance is necessary but well worth the time you put into it."
1268,Easy fill up of water.,I have the older model of Levoit humidifier where water refill is  after the container is picked up and turned upside down. Rotor cup injury made it hard for me to do that. Order this one and refill is from up top. Side is a slot to add essential oil on a pad. I like the features on this and water seem to last longer when it begins from full level.
1269,Sleep tight!,"This humidifier is perfect in every way.  Silent, has 3 settings and is easy to clean. I use distilled water as instructed and I have no issues with its' performance..well worth the price."
1270,Good . Fix app or have a way to adjust without app,It works really well. But no way to adjust the humidity level in auto without the app that is not working. It's just a humidifier. Should have a way to adjust it without an app IMO.
1271,Nice and quiet.,I like this. Very quiet.
1272,"Extremely quiet,and runs long on a filled tank","I like it because it has a classy,clean look.and it 's very quiet since we only run it at night while we're asleep. It runs for about 4 days when I put it on ""Low"" at 10PM, and turn it off 8 AM. Haven't used the scent pad yet."
1273,Buy it.,Love it. Works great at a good price.
1274,Excellent,"Actually increases the humidity in the room and is super silent.
I love the smart and Alexa capabilities of this unit."
1275,good to have one in your bedroom," Easy to clean, really  does the job."
1276,Super handy.,"Love this thing so much! It¡¯s so nice to be able to connect to it from the phone and check the humidity level and control the humidifier even when away. Love that you can turn off the displays lights even from the app. The only issue I¡¯ve had, and it¡¯s probably a user error on my part is that I cannot figure out how to change the humidity level for the auto mode. Not a big deal. I just check the level on my phone and manually turn it on or off if needed."
1277,It leaks,"I admittedly had high hopes, but it leaked horribly. Like, all over the place. There is no rubber seal or gasket of any kind between the base and water reservoir."
1278,Never knew how humid my apartment was,I love this humidifier; it actually feels like it does something other than just throw out some mist. Favorite feature is that it tells me how humid it is in the room so I can adjust it to my liking. It's great that it connects to my phone and Google assistant. Currently keeping it in the living room and even the cats are happy.
1279,Amazing Humidifier!,I love this humidifier! Tank is very large lots of smart features and pairs easily with smart home products.
1280,Large capacity oil fragrance slot Leaves white film on furniture,My favorite thing is the large capacity and being able to easily fill with a different container. The slot to add essential oil¡®s etc. is nice and light not overpowering. Good output. Nice easy to read display the app is fairly easy to set up and integrate with Alexa. If you have any dark furniture or countertops and run this thing continuously you will get a dusty white film which I guess is normal with these type of machines it doesn¡¯t stain anything you just have to wipe down your hard surfaces/windows etc. I did some research and it is mineral deposits from the water if you use distilled water I guess this doesn¡¯t happen I thought it was related to the oil but it is not. Very quiet. Fairly easy to clean. I would recommend.
1281,Great deal,"Great product, love the WiFi"
1282,Very quiet.  Love the automatic feature to determine if it should be on or not,I dislike that the you can't smell the oils
1283,Great,Works great. Just what I wanted.
1284,Received it today!,"We received it today (earlier then expected).  So far it¡¯s working nicely. We used purified water and spearmint oil (don¡¯t use too much oil just a few drops to avoid leaks). No problems with usage and WiFi control. Affordable. hardly any noise, I can hear a little trickle of water like sound which is actually soothing not bothersome (unlike the other humidifier and air purifier we have in the other rooms). The movable  nozzle and WiFi control are practical features.
Hopefully, it will last long and no issues in the future."
1285,It works great but you can't set a humidity,"Just high, medium and low......

What's the point of an app if you can't set  - anyways"
1286,Excellent product!,"We're in a 750 sq ft apartment. I have asthma and we both have allergies. We were using two typically sized humidifiers and a very small one on my bedside table. We ordered this humidifier planning to replace one, but it's replaced two (sm one is still bedside). It's very efficient; measures the humidity accurately; absolutely whisper quiet on its lowest setting. We love being able to fill it from the top only every 2.5-3 days and it's app on my iPhone works great! It's the second product we bought from Levoit, and we're very impressed with the quality of their products."
1287,Awesome Product,Love it
1288,Great features and poor execution,"I wanted to like this unitÿ. It was quiet, easy to fill and easy to cleanÿBUT, the controls only occasionally worked and after a week it started to leak.  So, we sent it back!"
1289,Best humidifier ever!,Very easy to operate and handle no need to turn upside down to fill with water no noise. I have tried many humidifiers in a very dry climate and none can be compared.
1290,Excellent Humidifier,Had this unit now for 2 months and have used it every day. It's extremely quiet and the unit works fantastic.  Highly recommend.
1291,Filled my apartment (650 sq ft) with hazy cloud of who knows what...,"It obviously is something in my water, I did filter the water before putting it into the tank but still filled my apartment with a ""hazy fog"" (best way to describe it). I was impressed with the features and its App. Too much of a hassle to get distilled water or something. I will have to find an alternative. Hope you have better luck with it! ** THE DEVICE SEEMS GREAT, IT DIDN'T WORK WELL WITH MY FILTERED WATER **"
1292,Smart product. Affordable price!,I love this thing! I love how it¡¯s smart capable. I bought it for my indoor plants and I am really happy with my purchase.
1293,Humidity,Works great for my peace Lilly and snake plants. My pathos are also doing awesome. The only cons would be the schedule  but may be owners at fault.  Somewhat easy to clean. But be sure to use distilled water.
1294,Awesome product,"I love it, it sure has helped out so much in my kids room. My kids wake up without dry or stuffy noses. I would definitely recommend."
1295,Not worth the hassle,Worked great but after a few weeks it started leaking all over my floor. Not sure if it was worth the hassle.
1296,Good product,Very easy to clean.
1297,Worth the purchase,"extremely quiet device, long lasting. Fits easily anywhere. Has been easy to keep clean."
1298,The best for Medical growers,Easy to use and great customer service...being disabled the WiFi saves me a a lot time.  I use mine in my grow room and make any adjustments I need from my  recliner.
1299,Quality unit,Works great in a grow tent
1300,Packs a Humid punch,Payed $60. Worth at least $80. This thing has some real output compared to a lot of high end larger units i have used. Well worth the Money.
1301,love it,This humidifier is so quiet and so simple to use.
1302,great product wish i bought 2 of em,love this item its quiet and great to handle and u can connect it to your alexa  love it would buy another on for the other rooms once the others break down def the better purchase
1303,Big Fan,"It pumps out the mist with great volume and distance.  I love being able to take off the top for intermittent fills instead of having to take the entire tank to the sink every time.  The night light could be a little brighter, but that's so insignificant it hardly warrants mentioning."
1304,Great humidifier,Works great and I love the fact you can connect it to Alexa. The essential oil defuser options is very nice.
1305,Love it,Love it
1306,Google smart home works well,I have it connected and control it thru nest hub 2. Works great. Quiet.
1307,L O V E this thing...,"This is the quietest humidifier I have ever owned.  It does an excellent job at keeping the humidity level right, it automatically adjusts the level of moisture it's putting out based on how the humidity is doing in the room... Meaning it kicks into high gear when needed then goes down to a very low speed when needed, all on it's own.  The nightlight is kind of convenient as well.  I do highly recommend this product, you won't regret this purchase... I am a levoit customer for life.  Their customer service is also amazing... My old machine had started making noises and they were quick to help me identify the noises and explain what my mistake was that caused that issue.  Totally my fault for being careless when cleaning.  Please... READ THE DIRECTIONS... :)"
1308,A Good Buy but Hygrometer is Waster,I have to return the product as the humidity level on the humidifier was way off when I was comparing it with two other hygrometers. Apart from that it is an eye catching product with very less noise.
1309,Best one,"Works great, easy to fill."
1310,Best Humidifier WiFi works great!,Their humidifiers work great and I love the wifi feature that I can schedule when it runs. I had an issue with another model and their customer service was super quick to handle the situation. This is the only brand I will buy. Just ordered my 3rd one. _
1311,Nice product with good app,Good pricing and quality. The mobile app is very well designed and great integration with smart home app
1312,Levi it-Cool mist humidifier,Received it yesterday. Set it up and downloaded the app. Works great and pretty quiet!
1313,Decepcionada,Ya no me gusto porque lo devolv¨ª y no me reembolsaron completo mi dinero  y agarro un mal olor el producto y ya no se conectaba con Alexa estoy tan decepciona  porque mi reembolso no fue completo
1314,Great machine but requires frequent cleaning,"I¡¯ve had this humidifier for about a month now and I like it but as noted in previous comments the app is a bit wonky. The timer setting does not work correctly. Ex: I set the machine to turn on at 11pm but the app shows a different time, like 6:10pm. I¡¯ve tried correcting the time but to no avail, I just left it alone. It still turned on roughly around 11pm though. My only complaint about this humidifier is how frequent I get a message that it¡¯s time to clean the machine. I was hoping at least 1 or 2 x¡¯s a week but since having this machine, I get an alert every other day. I use distilled vinegar to clean as instructed but feel like I¡¯m just wasting it. I¡¯ve gone about every 3-4 days cleaning it, humidity set between 30% - 40% running only from 11pm to 7am. Other than that, I do love this machine. It¡¯s very easy to handle and fill. I personally prefer to control it through the app as others seem to dislike this feature."
1315,Quiet humidifier for bedroom,Super quiet easy to use with app
1316,Mine leaks I hate it,It leaks
1317,VERY IMPRESSED!!!,"I am a houseplant collector and have tried many humidifiers over the years & was quite unhappy when my previous one died and I had to replace it. I did some research and asked tons of fellow planty people and finally decided on this one. I usually prefer warm mist, because I keep my house cold but I couldn¡¯t pass this one up and I am so glad I didn¡¯t. It¡¯s got a top fill tank, completely quiet, has Bluetooth capabilities so that I can control it from an app. It can be scheduled to run by time or humidity range. (6am-10pm or it will auto off at 75% humidity etc) It has a night light and display that is easy to see, even from another room. Easy to assemble and clean & came with the option to add essential oils (though I can¡¯t comment on that function because I don¡¯t use it) Also, you can control the mist level (& the highest setting is very impressive) and the direction of the mist.
DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY."
1318,"Quite, works well and tells you when you need to clean it or its out of water","Quite, works well and tells you when you need to clean it or its out of water"
1319,Great for large room,Quiet and clean... the app is easy to use and accurate
1320,Good value. good choice.,Easy to fill and clean. Ultra quiet. Humidistat worke very well.
1321,Does not function without app .,"Can not use without app , app wants your location . This is a humidifer not a gps map."
1322,MAKE SURE YOU READ THE CLEANING SUGGESTIONS - FIRST THING TO DO!!!,MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH ENDED UP IN THE HOSPITAL WITH HUMIDIFIER CAUSED PNEUMONIA.  I GOOGLED IT AND IS A TYPE OF SICKNESS CAUSED BY THE HUMIDIFIER  BECAUSE APPARENTLY THIS UNIT SHOULD BE CLEANED EVERY OTHER DAY WITH SOAP & WATER.  SO IF YOU CAN'T  COMMIT TO CLEANING IT THAT FREQUENTLY - DON'T USE  ONE.  WE WERE IN THE HOSPITAL TWICE WITH THIS ILLNESS!!
1323,"Silent , effective - would definitely buy again",Super easy to setup and absolutely silent which makes it perfect for use in bedrooms. Has manual and auto modes and app to control from your phone.  The only  part I don¡¯t like is they recommend using distilled water but my apartment is super dry and I go through about a gallon of water every 2 days in humidifier and that is too much to get my hands on. So I am just using tap water and it¡¯s been 2 months and it¡¯s just fine. I have bought 2 more since my Initial purchase for us win other locations
1324,Cannot get this to work with Google Home/Assistant,"One of the main reason I bought this humidifier is because of the ability to control it from my Google Home and assistant. However, I just cannot get this to work. They paired but I just cannot control it. I will probably return it for another more reliable choices."
1325,Like It,"Yes, this is quite, easy to clean (most are not).  If you purchase this item-you will like it.  eom"
1326,Efficient quiet humidifier suitable for large bedroom,Efficient quiet humidifier suitable for large bedroom
1327,Kind of a pain,"Just don't like it. No one wants to use their phone to work it, so it's not even being used. Worked ok for humidity I guess, but nothing more than a basic steamer would do."
1328,Satisfied,Works as advertised.
1329,Best Humidifier I've ever owned!,I purchased this back in December and LOVE everything about it. I have been using distilled water and have not had to clean it once all winter. Also the easy fill is a dream and there is no noise. Happy happy happy!
1330,Inside is red,The inside has turned red
1331,Nope....,"This is my second try at this unit. I loved the description, the price , the connectivity. But it is deficient. I get messages saying the tank is emty(it¡¯s not), it turns itself off(even when it is programmed) and is difficult to continuously use.
I would not recommend!"
1332,"Works well, and it¡¯s VERY quiet.  App is super-easy to use.","I¡¯m very happy with this purchase. Been using it for about a week.  It sits on the nightstand right next to my bed, and it operates so quietly that it doesn¡¯t bother me one bit.  Being able to turn off the light and screen is great.  It¡¯s just there, runs quietly and effectively and I think it¡¯s improved my health.  I live in a desert area where the outside humidity is rarely over 7-10%.  This humidifier keeps my bedroom between 40-50% without trouble, and I don¡¯t bother shutting the door to make it easier. I leave the humidifier in auto mode at 45% and it lasts about two-three days before needing a refill.

The app connected quickly and very easily and connected to my WiFi network with no trouble at all. I wish all internet-of-things devices I owned connected this easily.

Only two negatives I can think of:
* You can¡¯t really adjust the humidity level without using the app.  All other functions work from the buttons, but I don¡¯t think there¡¯s a way to make any adjustments without having a smartphone to connect to.
* On iOS, the app¡¯s Schedule function doesn¡¯t work AT ALL. If you set it to start or stop at just about any time, it just defaults to 5:20 pm for some reason. Can¡¯t be used at all. This isn¡¯t a function I have any need for, but I thought I should mention it here.  I suspect that this is just a generic app to use with lots of various devices, so I think this is much more of an app developer issue than something from L¨ºvoit."
1333,Perfect for the bedroom or small spaces,Works well. The Alexa control is wonderful. Cleaning takes several steps but not too difficult.
1334,Chapped winter skin bloody nose,"My nose was constantly bleeding and basically a scab. My face was so chapped with this winter weather that I had open sores on my jaw line.
I started using this and within a week, my nose was back to normal and my face begin holding more moisture. I put it on my bedside table and ran it all night. I love this humidifier so so much."
1335,No good,Never works at the percentage i need it to be if i set it to 55 it goes up to 80 might be cutting my losses soon and gettting a different one
1336,Happy so far!,Not quite as intuitive as my previous Levoit and Crane humidifiers. Pretty easy to clean and I really like the ability to add watwr from the top with a wide opening as the entire top comes off. The sleep mode works well
1337,Amazing product!,"This humidifier is so well made and works perfectly.  The app/wifi functionality is kind of a novelty but still does work well.  Overall this is a great buy, no regrets."
1338,Wifi smart Humidifier,"Good humidifier, small to medium size rooms, not commercial grade so don¡¯t expect that for the price. Does it¡¯s  job well and the app works great, just had a good update now there¡¯s more advanced options within the setting. Better than expected for my first wifi smart humidifier."
1339,It's a great product!,This humidifier is awesome! It does a great job in my grow tents. I like how you can control it from your phone also. Recommend this one and or the Levoit Hot and Cold mist one.
1340,Great value,I suffer with allergies and this really helps.  Works great!
1341,Easy integration into our Alexa system and Refilling a breeze.,"A larger reservoir requires less refilling and due to easy access, no longer requires us to break the system down, turn it upside down and do the refilling in the kitchen sink to prevent spillage."
1342,Super quiet dependable,"High tech! Controlled by smartphone or manually. Gives alert for cleaning time. Auto shut off when water is empty. Easy to fill from the top. No lifting, no spilling. Rotating nozzle to direct mist without moving base. Only wish it came in black or dark grey. The stark white does not match anything I own. But the device functions silently and very well."
1343,Effective,I can control it from my phone. Awesome
1344,Winter Necessities,"Winter NECESSITY!!! After a 2 month trail, I purchased a 2nd for another room! A winter must have - especially to those with allergies & asthma!

Do you NEED the app to work it - NO!
-control mist levels, nightlight & display on/off via touch buttons

Do you WANT to have the app - ABSOLUTELY YES!!!

- You can completely customize it to target the humidity your wants/needs with auto on/off +/- 5% of your customized set target. E.I. set humidity level for 60% it turns on when it drops to 55% & off when it hit 65%
- This will save motor/functioning lasting longer
- If you can't get outta bed or don't want to disturb a fussy baby you finally rocked asleep (or just lazy & don't want to get outta bed) you can turn on or up the humidity not only through your phone but any smart home setup you have (Alexa or Google)
- It will notify you when it's time to clean it (for those who are forgetful and/or chaotic household)

Otherwise UBER easy to clean & fill. A tank can easily last you more than 24hrs. No special filters required. NO small parts and/or nooks & crannies you can't get to to clean properly. Very quiet. Nightlight & display on/off optional - so pitch black in the room if you want it! I will NEVER go to any old regular humidifier EVER AGAIN!!! Sending 1 out to my niece & nephew each for this winter coming up now it's been thoroughly tested for over a year by Auntie Ash 

These are MY OWN words, I received nothing from leaving this review - nor to I have anything to gain from leaving it! Just do yourself the favor - if you suffer from allergies or breathing issues or have kids (or new baby) and look no further this is your solution for winter time (dry climate) suffering!

Still in my never ending search (over a decade quest) to find a EO Diffuser to meet my needs.........."
1345,Noise ZERO and quality TEN,Integration with alexa: All is easy . Very good product. Recommended
1346,Schedule Function doesn¡¯t Work!!!,"I like that this is too loading, it makes refilling the water nice and easy. The schedule function does not work. I have programmed it to turn off at 11:30pm and I can see it shooting out humidity at 12:30am. That¡¯s the reason for one star. It doesn¡¯t work."
1347,Humidity level meter very inaccurate,"We¡¯ve owner two of the previous models (Levoit LV600HH) and they¡¯ve been decent. Connected this new version (Levoit Classic 300s) up side by side and, for  some reason, the new one reads the relative humidity about 20% higher than the old version. I took a picture of this along with a calibrated hygrometer (67¡ã F, 49% RH) and it is clearly reading way too high. We¡¯ll see if it settles out in a few days, but as nice as the other features are, the automatic setting can¡¯t work properly if it is so far off."
1348,Phenomenal product. Disregard the negative reviews.,Phenomenal product. Disregard the negative reviews.
1349,Good product for the price point,"Good product for the price point
Everything works well except for the essential oil¡¯s pad... doesn¡¯t give much of a fragrance and kinda gums up the works so you have to clean it more often"
1350,Great for Allergy sufferers and Plant Parents!,"I haven¡¯t had it long but it works great!  I like the fact you can control it with an App using your phone.  I took one star off because I have to refill it often.  If you have a small room, you don¡¯t have to worry about refilling often but if you have a larger room like a living room, you¡¯ll have to refill everyday specially when you set the humidity level at 40% or higher in the dead of winter when humidity level goes down to 10-20%.  I have another humidifier along with this one and it helps me because I have allergies all year long and it gets worse when the air is dry.  Also, I have a lot of house plants (around 200-300) so this humidifier helps a lot.  It keeps e leaves from turning brown when humidity is higher.  Tip: Don¡¯t set it over 50% humidity because you¡¯ll have mold growth in the air."
1351,BEWARE defective units will turn off unexpectedly,"As several reviewers have mentioned, there's a chance that the unit you receive will turn off by itself. This is different from the auto on/off as the unit will turn off long before it reaches the set Humidity. There's a way to program the unit to turn back on within the veSync app, but this ""off mode"" renders the unit completely unresponsive to the app. This means that all the ""smart features"" built into this unit are effectively useless if you happen to get a unit that does turn off by itself.

On paper great product. There's a chance you'll get a smart humidifier but you could be like me and end up with a big paper weight."
1352,is worth the money in size and preformance,this levoit is amzing! love it
1353,cool mist,Works great. Lots of options and love having an app to see whats going on.
1354,SO EASY TO CLEAN!,Omg finally a humidifier that I can actually clean. It also does not get gross like others I¡¯ve had. Really really really great quality!
1355,Broke,Broken already
1356,Not so smart,"Initially got captivited because it was smart and it's compatible to alexa. As someone who's forgetful all the time it's nice to have it added to my routine. It was doing good at first, set up and instructions were very easy. Noise is almost nothing. Very easy to clean too.

Then, after a week passed, it got disconnected with the wifi so i have to reboot, have to re-register it on alexa. Also, since it was having a hard time with wifi set up i had to carry it closer to the router. Wasn't too bothered by it honestly.

Then, another few days passed, like 2 or 3. Alexa says humidifier wasn't responding AGAIN! I gave it a benefit of a doubt that it might be my wifi, but NO. I also had the air purifier from levoit and it works like a charm never had a problem with connections.

Almost every week i had to reboot and its getting on my nerves now. It's been 2 months past the return period so I'm stuck with this. I gave it so many chances because honestly the product was great but since I also paid extra just to have a smart feature, I would expect that feature to work. I wouldn't be upset if it wasn't smart then i would've given it 5 stars no doubt. :/"
1357,Plants love it,I recommend the new version compared to the old levoit humidifier.
1358,Perfect Humidifier,"I was looking for humidifier exactly like this one. Quiet, high output and easy to clean. What I love about it is the top fill without need to take the water container off. I've been using it whole winter with RO water and had no scale build up. To store it I just had to empty the tank let it dry and ready for next winter. I absolutely love the app to set all settings remotely and night feature when the display turns off at night so you can sleep with no light emitting from device. I love it so much that I got 2 of them."
1359,Not pleased,"I have a house full of technology and love tech that makes my life simpler, but why would anyone associate an app with such a simple gadget as a humidifier? The app only makes a simple thing more complicated. What¡¯s next- apps for our toothbrush and knife and fork? There are some things which do not benefit from unnecessary technology."
1360,Great product,"Amazing humidifier, I love the WiFi feature"
1361,Great rH control,Previous humidifiers I used leaked or had little pieces of sediment in it even tho I only use r.o. water. This one has none of those problems. Best part is you can easily control all functions from the app on your phone. I'm definitely getting a few more.
1362,Awesome,"Super product , well built, easily connectedness to WiFi, easy to use app. Awesome!"
1363,Best value smart humidifier you can buy.,Top fill makes it easier to refill. The humidity status is accurate and the smart feature works perfectly as well.
1364,Very satisfied customer,Easy to use and easy to clean I love it the best purchase ever
1365,Adds Moisture to the Air,Just as it's supposed to do!
1366,quietish,"its semi quiet, there's a small noise that you can ignore but once you hear it you hear it, the nightlight isn't bright at all, it connects well to wifi and has a good distance too, I don't think the oil diffuser works well but the humidifier does fill the room well"
1367,Excellent humidifier!,It is whisper quiet and works effectively and efficiently at increasing the humidity in our large room. The refill water spout on top is The Best feature - as it eliminates water drippage and stress on your back. Highly recommend!
1368,Yes! Buy it now,It works so good and definitely helps with stuffiness
1369,Good item.,Good value.
1370,Good product,Very quiet
1371,Worth the money,Def recommend this humidifier
1372,Bacteria appears before use up the water,"It was all good when I bought it and use it. But after using it within a week, the water vapor makes me feel very uncomfortable, I started to have symptoms like dizziness and feeling cold although it's the same temperature as yesterday. So I checked the tank and I found the water in the tank has strange smells which I guess are some unknown bacterias.

I know some people may say you should follow the instruction to clean the tank every week, but I have not used up the water yet. If I really need to clean it every week rather than clean it after I used up the water, why should I even buy a large tank humidifier instead of a small one? Just wasting the money?"
1373,No manual humidity control.  water condenses on cover dripping on surfaces,I have the unit in a large family room with vaulted ceiling.  Unit runs 24/7 since purchased a few weeks ago.  Fill in am and before bed.  Water condenses on top of the unit and will drip down the side of the unit.  It is quiet as most of these types are.  ZERO manual humidity control. (NO I should not have to dl a two function app to change it)
1374,Better sleep,I like that it works
1375,"High capacity, remote control via cell phone function, very quiet","I love the ability to control this device via my cell phone. I use it mainly for my plants that require high humidity. The customization for target humidity is awesome.

I hate cleaning this, though. There are still parts that are difficult to reach, even with the little brush they include.

However, if you want a dependable, high capacity, remotely controlled humidifier - this is PHENOMENAL!!

I do really love it and use it every day."
1376,Awesome,Very Quiet Easy To Fill and Clean and Last a Long time on 1 Fill.
1377,Quiet and Easy to Fill!,Finally... a great humidifier that is super easy to fill (from the top) and I can turn on/off from the app on my phone. It¡¯s extremely quiet too! Took the expensive one I bought at Costco back; it was the stupidest design ever.
1378,Best. Ever.," Love this humidifier. It has night mode, it is easy to clean, has top fill, and several different mist settings. I really love how the smartphone app tells you when to clean it and refill it if you haven¡¯t been keeping tabs on it. Only thing that isn¡¯t great is that when using essential oils, you can¡¯t really smell them, but it¡¯s really not a big deal overall."
1379,Best purchase,Love love love it! The phone capabilities are awesome and so convenient. The auto setting is so nice as well. I spend a lot less time trying to mess with my humidifier to get it to the right setting now! Love this thing!
1380,Love it.,"Alright, so my fianc¨¦ and I were in need of a new humidifier as our old one was getting our floor wet.... well this one has been amazing. We set it up with our google home and are able to activate it without having to touch it. Which is an upgrade to us, cleaning it is very easy. Filling it is too, i don¡¯t normally have to fill it up for like a whole day and a half. Depending on what setting we have it on. Now for those complaint about the essential oil, look, idk where you guys missed it but you CAN in fact use the essential oil. You¡¯re just not suppose to insert it with the water. If you read the whole instructions, you¡¯ll see a page dedicated to informing you how to use the essential oil with this humidifier. Anyways, love this purchase and if we ever need another one, you bet I will be buying again."
1381,Best one yet!,Holds a lot more water than our others and the auto feature is incredible. We will see how they hold up.
1382,Adds moisture,"Easy to use, effective and large water reservoir."
1383,Mold factory!,"I cannot tell you enough not to buy this.
The bottom portion takes in water but doesn¡¯t output it all correctly, causing mold to grow. I took the tank off last night to refill it to find black mold and slime all throughout the bottom of the tank (not pictured.) This is not well designed and was circulating mold into my home. So disappointed."
1384,Good product,Fantastic for 1 large room.
1385,"Great! Easy to clean, quiet and goes completely dark!","This product has been amazing! I've searched for a good humidifier for a long time and tried several different ones that worked but we're very difficult to clean. This one is great all around!

It effectively humidifies our child's room to the desired percentage. It holds a large amount of water that will last a long time. It is very quiet! One of the best things about it is that it can go completely dark in sleep mode. Other humidifiers I've had still have some kind of light on which is really annoying when trying to help a baby sleep. This one goes completely dark which is amazing! The app that you use with it is nothing special but also not bad. It could use a little bit of tweaking but it works just fine.

This humidifier is also very easy to clean! It still takes time because there's lots of parts to clean, however you can clean every part which is different from lots of other humidifiers that make it impossible to get to certain parts of the humidifier.

Definitely recommend!"
1386,Humidity and a lovely scent,Great humidifier. I especially love that it has a place to use essential oils!
1387,Best humidifier I¡¯ve ever owned. Set it and forget it!,Love this thing! Set it and forget it. I keep it on low and the tank last 3-4 days. I set it on a timer for my normal sleeping pattern and never have to turn it on or off. It alerts my phone when it¡¯s empty or needs cleaning.
1388,Good humidifier,Love the wifi
1389,Cheap for a reason,"Unfortunately this is one of many products that force you to give private data to be able to use basic functions. God knows how your personal is treated, shared, sold, and kept. Not recommended"
1390,Needs distilled water. Poor aroma diffuser.,"This is an excellent device that performs as claimed.  Well made.  But, in my urban location without a hard water reputation, it detects all the minerals (and other foreign matter?) in tap water, separates them/it and delivers a cloud that includes everything.  The result is a layer of white 'powder' over everthing - furniture, items on counters, wall hangings etc.  As I need the humIdification, I've bought a counter-top water distiller (1 gal), and this has solved the problem.  Can't say I wasn't warned, but nevertheless the magnitude of this was quite unexpected.  It's likely that distilled water will be a must."
1391,Great little humidifier,"Great little humidifier for a bedroom or small living room. I fill it up every other day and it works great. I've used tap water and it works well. Cleaning hasn't been needed just yet but it would be easy.. Filling is easy either by cups or taking the tank to the sink.
WiFi part works good. I've set up schedule for it to run from 3pm to 6am in bedroom while sleeping. And I set it to turn off display to sleep and on when I get home to see humidity levels. App works great and simple to operate.."
1392,Super quiet easy to use!,"Super quiet! Stopped my dogs from coughing during the night, helped my husband¡¯s snoring. Very easy to use. Just wish it didn¡¯t require distilled water."
1393,Love this machine!,"Great humidifier! Super happy with my purchase. The only reason I didn¡¯t give this machine a 5 star review is because of the operating buttons. I read complaints about the machine not working upon delivery on a few reviews. I believe the button design is to blame. It took me a few time to figure out the touch sensor design. The buttons are not raised so it¡¯s hard to tell if your turning it on. There is a slight delay when powering on if your fingers are cold. You just need to tap the buttons, no need to push hard. I think there touch technology is confusing for some consumers. Other than that, this is a GREAT product. I would definitely buy this again and recommend it for others. It¡¯s very easy to fill. I love the essential oil feature, two products in one. I sleep with this machine next to my bed, it¡¯s makes very little noise. I haven¡¯t had to clean it yet. The easy access to the tank should make it very easy to clean. If you¡¯re in the market for a humidifier look no further."
1394,best choice,This is the perfect humidifier! It's big and so convenient to add water or clean. It's also smart so I don't need to turn it on and off manually.
1395,Super happy,Absolutely no complaints. No noise and functionality is flawless. Paired to my alexa easy just wished there were more control options than on and off with voice. Tip is used filtered water. I used faucet and quickly went filtered with my brita. Otherwise you'll get white spots depending on your water and overtime the buildup may harm the humidifier
1396,Such a great humidifier,during the winter with our forced air heat it gets VERY dry and we run this humidifier in our downstairs which includes the kitchen dining room and living room.  It works all day long and is basically silent.  I couldn¡¯t have hoped for a better product.
1397,Yes! It's true - for large rooms,"Exatly purchased as seller describe ""for large room"".  First humidifier that I purchased that works in large room with cathedral ceiling - thank you Levoit"
1398,Great humidifier,"Bought this to sit next to the piano to maintain humidity. Our room is large and wide open so I was a little worried, but it keeps it steadily around 35% (which is good for a very dry climate). A full refill lasts about a day, running it constantly on high.

The humidity sensor is accurate when the humidifier isn't actually running, but when it's running the humidity is much higher where the sensor is than in the room. It's best to get external sensors and sit them around them room you're trying to maintain.

Humidifier is very quiet even when running on high, I was surprised. Overall a great product!"
1399,Amazing and funny Humidifier,"I have bought 4. We can control by Google voice, Alexa and app. We can schedule to turn on/off, the humidity level. Fantastic."
1400,touch controls do not work,I bought 2 of these and one works occasionally and the other not at all.
1401,Not that impressed,"It works, however...

Humidity gauge seems WAY off. Generally measures 10+ percentage points different from 2 other gauges I have in the room that are in sync with each other. Also, it shows wild swings in humidity that aren¡¯t in line with the other gauges. That being said, it¡¯s quiet and as long as you use distilled water, it put out a clean, non foggy mist."
1402,Best humidifier,By far the best humidifier I have bought over the years! Easy to clean and fill. It¡¯s quiet too. Love it!
1403,Best Smart purifier - you won¡¯t regret it,Outstanding device. The noise is so quite also the power of this device is amazing. I have a large 500sqft room and it takes of it easy. Also the smart feature was done well. It¡¯s amazing and really easy to use as a smart device. Great job to the company.
1404,Love it,Love that I can sync with my phone.
1405,"Great, quiet, and App is amazing",It's quiet and the sleep mode is excellent for the bedroom. The app on the phone is amazing and easy to use. 5 star!
1406,PLEASE READ,"The main features of this Humidifier is very nice:
1. Noise level
2. Sleep mode
3. Easy to clean

All the above are 5-stars ... BUT it is similar to others and leaks!

This is the 2nd brand one I've tested and both of them leak. The previous brand from TaoTonics, I tested two of them and both leak. I'm giving this two stars because the 3 points above are good, but -3 stars since it leaks!"
1407,Great Customer Service,One of the steps in setting up the humidifier was omitted from the instruction video. I contacted the support centre and got advice and had my humidifier working in less than 24 hours. The timely customer service and the efficiency of the support staff were great.
1408,Levoit Air Purifier,I have severe sinusitis most of the time. This is the third time I bought an air purifier and this product is the BEST air purifier I¡¯ve ever had. It helps me a lot to breathe and had a good sleep at night.  Highly recommended...
1409,Perfect for smaller rooms,Nice humidifier. Very quiet. First used in 18x24 living room with furnace going & this just couldn't get the humidity up to a decent degree. Moved it to 15x15 bedroom and it does help there. Like the sleep button option to turn off lights. Doesn't blow me away but worth the price of you're not looking for something too large.
1410,Good features,"I really like the app feature. I absolutely love the top fill. I like the timer setting.
Only it started leaking all over one night, thank goodness my husband caught it.not sure why that happened"
1411,Humidifier,Does a great job of raising your humidity.  Easy to fill
1412,Better than expected,This is the best cool air vaporizer I have used.  I especially appreciate the automatic humidity control.
1413,Easy to use,it is very easy to set up and control with the app on your phone.
1414,Leaked everywhere!,"This humidifier is absolute junk.

Our last large humidifier that we use in the living room in the winter just died so I was looking for something to replace it. I settled on this model. I wasn't thrilled about the shape of it since our last one was a tall one that held 2 gallons.

I opened this up and set it up. I filled it with water and turned it on. I had to push the on button about 5 times before it turned on. When it finally did, I immediately noticed the noise. A few hours later I checked on it, and there was water all over the floor.

This will be returned immediately."
1415,Quiet and works great!,Love how quiet it is and being able to use the app to control it. Great product for a great price.
1416,Buy this machine.,"This Levoit humidifier works and looks great.  I¡¯ve had mine for several months and it has seldom stopped humidifying.  Extremely quiet, easy fill and comes with wifi control.  Highly recommended."
1417,Name it something funny,"I love that this connects to my Alexa. I am still adjusting to creating a ""smart"" home. But fun suggestion: name it something fun. I named it ""WAP"" (Wet Air Producer) so when Alexa gives me alerts that my WAP needs water I get a nice giggle during the quarantine isolation days. Or telling Alexa to turn my WAP on. Also a fun giggle."
1418,Best Smart Humidifier to purchase,"I bought this for my bedroom because the low humidity was messing with my sleep. I love this thing especially the smart features. I use google home. I can ask google the humidity and it tells me what it is set to and what the current humidity is and it is accurate most times. The times when it is not accurate is you you use a water with a high temperature when filling. I don't know where the humidity sensor is but it is throws off the detection. This can be seen when you turn it on and expect it to turn on but the threshold is set and because of the water temp the threshold appears to be exceeded. You can have to turn on the humidifier manually and turn off threshold and wait a few minutes for the sensor to get its bearings. Another instance is when the you don't have the humidifier on and you ask google for the humidity, I don't think the sensor is set up to deliver the correct humidity to google unless the humidifier is running. You can have a humidity I guess stored in the output from hours ago and has not been updated until the humidifier is ran."
1419,Is NOT accurate!!! Warning,Is NOT accurate!!! Warning
1420,Stop searching and buy this.,"Fantastic product, easy to use, connected options are great."
1421,Great,Incredibly easy to set up. Love the Alexa connectivity. Extremely quiet
1422,Leaves residue!,What's this residue?!
1423,Stop looking and buy this one.,I love that you can add essential oils. It¡¯s top fill and the bottom of the container is flat and has handles so filling at the sink or from a pitcher of water makes it SO EASY! It¡¯s Bluetooth so your phone will tell you it¡¯s levels or when the water runs out and the humidity. I have mine hooked up to my Alexa which is capable of turning it on and off and switching to night light mode. I have the LEVOIT air purifier too which I love (wish they had the Bluetooth though when I bought). LEVOIT is a great brand and they have a modern sleek design and they serve their purpose perfectly.
1424,Great choice.,Like the display and controls. Holds a lot of water.
1425,Good unit and value.,"Like the WiFi capability and being able
to schedule automatic on/off. Aromatherapy is a nice feature. Operates totally silently."
1426,"Its quiet, can go 24 hrs without refilling, and its functionality is not annoying","So far so good! Virtually silent on any output level. I generally run the unit on its highest output, have done so for almost 2 weeks and no issues, no change in it being whisper quiet. I like that I can see exactly how much water is in it so I know when to refill. I'm a big fan of the easy top fill where you just lift off the top piece, no screwing it on and off or having to flip it. I just fill a pitcher and reload it. I would say the humidity level is off... We have it in a decent sized bedroom and I keep another thermostat with humidity check in there about 6 ft away and it generally shows the humidity level listed on the humidifier to be about 10% higher then what my thermometer is reading out...but its definitely putting out humid air and it definitely holds enough water that I can go a whole day without refilling it even on its highest mode...i love that there is no wick to repurchase and change out and the unit top that pulls off is plenty big to make cleaning easy. The app to control it from your phone if you want to was actually very easy to install and set up and works without error.  In short, I would buy this again. Its only been a few weeks but I'm a believer."
1427,Poorly designed leaks water all over floor. I wouldn't bother...,Bought one and it leaked in the same spot that other reviewers reported. Filled it and turned it on only to wake up in the morning to all of the water that was in the tank on my hardwood floor. It also either showed that the humidity level was very high and wouldn't turn on or would. run non-stop. I bought a replacement. It's missing the little magnet that tells the base that that the tank is on and it doesn't work. I miss my Air-O-Swiss.
1428,Very Quiet,We love this humidifier. It is very quiet even on the highest setting and it is easy to clean - especially since we use diatilled water only.
1429,Super quiet!,Puts out a lot of H20 but is super quiet. I like that there is no filter to replace. Thoroughly cleaning the unit was easy. Filling the unit from the top is a must have feature some humidifiers don¡¯t offer.
1430,I bought this for my plants,I love this!  I can control and monitor the humidity level from my phone! Very easy to use and fill.
1431,AMAZING! Best kept beauty secret!,This is the most awesome humidifier ever! It worked immediately after filing with water and turning it on. Cool mist billowed out of the top like fluffy clouds. I have been using the unit at night in sleep mode in the bedroom. It¡¯s nearly silent and completely dark. I swear it looks like I¡¯ve had a facial after a week! LOVE!
1432,Larger capacity then advertised,"I remember the ad said it held 1.3 gallons but I am finding it holds  more like 1.5 gallons.  It has great output and is easy to clean with white ammonia.
Could not get it to work with my WIFI but my set-up is more like 5Ghz than the lower one.  It is a humidifier so the WiFi connection would be nice but not needed overall."
1433,I bought two!,When it got really cold last month my humidity dropped below 20% so I picked one of these up.  It worked so good I picked up another for the basement.  I love that I can see the humidity and change settings through my phone (WiFi).  I would and have recommended these to friends.  Very happy!
1434,A humidifier that really works!,"This is the most effective and efficient humidifier I have ever used. It can increase the relative humidity in a 500 sq ft bedroom from 28 to 45% in less than 1hr, and keep it there, silently, for hours."
1435,Works great,Great humidifier. Practically silent and night mode turns off all illumination. Can also be controlled over wifi.
1436,Great humidifier!,Amazing humidifier all in all ! No noise at all . If you have Alexa in the home it is so simple to tell her to switch up the settings for you
1437,Use the app,Works great.  Be sure tonuse the app on your phone as the controls on the unit are erratic.
1438,Works Well and WIFI is a Big Bonus!,"I really like this machine. I purchased it to replace a much cheaper one I bought. It's easy to fill. Easy to clean and makes no noise at all. It has an electronic display to show you how humid the room is. The display is really bright but if you use the app (the device has wifi) you can turn the display off.

I also love that if I forget to turn it on before I'm in bed I can use the app to do that too. You can use the app to control every function on the humidifier, including the night light.

One note on the night light. It may provide comfort to some, but it is too dim to allow you to see around the room at night. If you were in an unfamiliar room you'd still bump into everything. But for me, I like my room pitch black so I don't use this function anyway."
1439,I haven't woken up to a blood bath since my purchase!,"This machine is so quite, you won't even notice it's running! I love that I can see the humidity level on the screen, and I haven't had any nose bleeds since I set this bad boy up! What a blessing."
1440,Most accurate,"Out of the 3 humidifiers I have, this one controls the humidity the best and most accurate with the least amount of swing from lower to higher RH.  My other humidifier would swing from 40% to 60% RH when I set it to 50%.  This one swings from 53% to 57% when set to 55%.  MUCH more accurate!  I love being able to control from phone!"
1441,Trouble connecting,I purchased 2 of these units but could not get one to connect.  Levoit customer service was not at all helpful so I¡¯m returning both.
1442,Leaks!!!,"Love that it has such a large tank and it is easy to clean but it leaks. Flooded my floor. Thought the first one I received was just a malfunctioned one, but second one does the same thing, so disappointed."
1443,Wrong room humidity reading,"The humidifier humidity reading is way above the actual room humidity, see attached photo. The actual  room humidity is 32% which I have confirmed with two other humidity sensors, while the humidifier reading on the device is 56%. This may be due to the humidity sensor location at the bottom of the device and it reads the wrong humidity, or the device is faulty. This makes the automatic humidity control setting useless. Therefore I leave it permanently on and monitor the  humidity with my accurate humidity sensor reading."
1444,Water accumulates near the mist output,See the photo - Water accumulates near the mist output and eventually drips to the table that the humidifier sits. I contacted LEVOIT and they told me it is designed that way! This is the most ridiculous response that I have ever received from customer services and their engineer teams. So be aware this humidifier may cause water damage to the surface that it sits and it is designed that way LOL
1445,Mildew smell won¡¯t go away,"This humidifier smelled like musty mildew from the second day we got it. I cleaned and cleaned and still, the mildew smell will not go away unless the unit is off. I¡¯ve had enough and returning."
1446,This is my favorite humidifier,I have a ton of different humidifiers and this is by far my favorite. It's super easy to operate with no guess work involved. Nice and quiet and works well. I love the easy different settings! I would buy again if needed for sure.
1447,Top-fill & 2 gallon tank! Perfect,"Love, love, love the 2-gallon tank & top fill. I don't use the app. I just turn it on & choose automatic humidity setting from the menu & that's it. It works great! LEVOIT is the only brand I will buy. I've tried others & all failed after the 1st year & one failed after a week! I am using a 5 or 6 yr old one in my bedroom & it's still working great! I use only distilled water @ 80 cents a gallons but otherwise they will get ruined with well water. Trust me, we've done that!"
1448,High-pitched electrical whine,"It has a high-pitched electrical whine when running. I exchanged it for another, and the second one had the same whine. It seems to work well. If you can ignore the whine it should be fine. Personally it drove me crazy."
1449,"Yay, finally an easy to clean humidifier!",I live in an area where it¡¯s winter half the year and very dry. This humidifier has been great! So easy to clean and very quite! I love you can download the app and use your phone as the remote. Would highly recommend it to anyone!
1450,Awesome,Worked great
1451,Top filling is much easier than the bottom fillers with their finicky gaskets.,Very quiet operation. In sleep mode it is both dark and quiet. Perfect for the bedroom!
1452,Does its job,Works well
1453,Just set and forget it.,This unit works just fine and keeps the humidity just at the right level it is great for the bedroom.
1454,Works Great,"I have absolutely no complaints about this product.
1. It DOES NOT leak. At least it does not for me. Just read the directions provided and you should be fine.
2. Its easy to connect to wifi.
3. It doesn't go through the water tank too fast. You can run it for nearly an entire day on high before it runs out."
1455,Nice sleep with humidity,I got this since my nose and mouth is dry at night.  This has helped a lot.
1456,White film it leaves is NOT worth the hassle.,The white film that it emits gets over everything in the house. This is really annoying and difficult to clean up.
1457,Great product!,It is quiet. It holds enough water to not have to mess with it on high for a couple of days.
1458,Super quiet,This is easy to fill and super quiet.  Turns off automatically when empty.
1459,Update: Leaks water  - Best looking humidifier but some problems,"Update: within a month it leaked water, I think the plunger design to close the water reservoir is poor. Returning bc of water leak

One of the best looking humidifiers and it puts a decent amount of moisture in the air. The humidity sensor is not accurate and the auto mode is pointless without the sensor working. If the sensor did work I wish you could adjust the auto target humidity without going in the app. The top fill makes it very easy to refill the water without schlepping a tank around. I will keep the humidity because of the top fill and aesthetics but if you want a humidifier with an auto mode look elsewhere."
1460,What's not to like? Well it's not compatible with Levoit's own Air Purifier. There is that.,"I was mostly happy with the vesync app to control the Levoit Air Purifier I bought so I thought why not get a Levoit humidifier to be controlled by the same app, so I bought this unit. Oh! Big mistake since running this purifier for just 4 to 5 hours and get the humidity level to a reasonable 40-45% the air purifier says bad air quality. Turn off the humidifier or switch to the bare bones $20 Wallyworld (WM) Mainstay and I can get and keep the humidity at that level and the air quality says good.

I got an email from vesync / levoit customer service asking how I liked the humidifier and I told them of the problem. I got a bubbly and oh so corporate response of how I should try placing them at opposite ends of the room or home. Well, it's been like that from the beginning. They went on to say that the units may not be compatible. I said they should disclose that on the product pages and the same customer service person told me they would 'think about that'. I would call this terrible and unconcerned customer service and poor product management to produce these two items that can't coexist in the same room.

Stay away."
1461,Quiet and efficient,The app really is not necessary.
1462,Good humidifier,Good performance
1463,Fantastic humidifier for plants,"I purchased this for some of my plant collection. Having gone through a few humidifiers in the past, I knew I wanted one that had a top fill & WiFi capabilities. This fits the bill perfectly. The only draw back, is that it has a single ¡°spout¡±. My previous humidifier had two spouts so you could direct the steam in multiple directions. I would still highly recommend this to any plant parent trying to prevent crispy tips."
1464,Noise is terrible but humidity is great,The only thing I do not like about this humidifier is that it gives off a very audible high pitch sound that is maddening when it¡¯s in the same room I¡¯m in. No way I could sleep with the sound in my bedroom and it¡¯s bothersome when I¡¯m sitting in the living room. Makes my ears feel like they¡¯re ringing. A little bummed because it has great humidity output.
1465,Made in China,"Just unpacked it, haven¡¯t used it yet. It says designed in CA. The machine also says ¡°made in China¡±"
1466,Best choice!,"Really low noise level. Much much easier to refill water with the top cap and great to have the auto mode: I don¡¯t need to worry to lower it if already reached the humidity, it does it automatically to the level I choose! And we can control it from the app, this is also great! And with the large water tank, it works all day long non stop without need to be refilling it. I really enjoyed it and I mean it! I have reviewed other options and definitely this is delivering all promised items with excellence."
1467,Great product.,This is perfect for our bedroom. Love that it¡¯s Bluetooth so if we are away I can turn it on & off remotely. The scheduler is handy as is the sleep mode that turns all the lighting off. Overall very happy.
1468,The best humidifier!,Very quiet and no filter to worry about!  Easy to clean.
1469,"Simple, quiet, easy","Best humidifier I have owned. I love that it's wifi and I dont have to leave my cozy spot to adjust settings. Love the nightlight, and love that the display can be turned off if I don't want the light. It is easy to fill, and easy to clean. Super quiet too! I forget it's on if the light is off."
1470,Love it!!,"Already I am loving this!!! I had one recently that was rated very high but a fairly new product. After using it for two days and not being very familiar with humidifiers, I noticed the mist was Just trickling out of her at the edges and not shooting up into the air, therefore my room Humidity never rose above 25ÿ This one after 10 minutes of turning it onÿ 35 and climbing! I love it!"
1471,Best thing ever,"It¡¯s well made, easy to set up, sooo quiet! The app is awesome and set up quickly without any issues! I¡¯m so happy with my purchase!!!!"
1472,Love it,Great product
1473,Great product amazing app features,"Upgraded to this unit from another, I need to be able to keep humidity where I want it and this does just that! Love the 1% adjustments with app"
1474,24 hours of continuous use not 60.,Burns through water much faster than indicated.  I run this overnight from 12-8 and have to refill it every three days.  So 24 hours of continuous use is more accurate than the 60 advertised.
1475,Humidifier not blowing out,Worked from January 14th to February 13th
1476,Stopped working after 3 days.,"Put this in my bedroom. At first, great. Would go through a whole tank in a night. Then it stopped working 3 days later. Won¡¯t even go thru a whole tank running 24 hours. It¡¯s also leaking at the seam where the tank connects to the base. Going to return it."
1477,Annoying noise,"I like the humidity monitor and the wide opening. Makes it easier to clean the top (but the base is still annoying to clean) but that¡¯s about it. I give it a one star because The motor makes an annoying whirring sound that¡¯s just loud enough to annoy you.  There are only three speeds, unlike other humidifiers that have a dial that let you control the amount of mist at a variable rate. I don¡¯t know if we¡¯ll keep it because it¡¯s just so l irritating.  I need to find something that¡¯s not going to sound like a bug in my ear."
1478,Easy to fill and easy to clean.,"This humidifier is the best ever! It's quiet, easy to fill, and easy to clean."
1479,Great Value,"Very nice product. Great features, quality materials, very nice design and works great so far. No issues. Setup was easy, the App was easy to setup and link to the humidifier. A little issue getting it to sync with Alexa but resolved quickly.  The App is very intuitive and easy to use. My only complaint is that the responsiveness of the App is slow and sluggish. Sometimes it times out and does not look like it implements the command, and then when you close and open back up, the command was initiated.  But overall very pleased."
1480,"Easy to use, Smart App is Nice, but difficult to turn on","I purchased the 6L, cool mist version that uses the smart phone app.  The directions clearly state that it needs to use distilled or purified water to avoid the white residue.  I use regular tap water and add in about a 1/2 c of vinegar every few times it gets filled and that seems to do the trick  (this will vary based on your water, obviously).  I did find that turning the unit on/off at the base wasn't easy.  It took several attempts to get the thing to turn on or off as pressing the button didn't seem to do anything.  Once I set up the Smart App, though, the unit turned on/off flawlessly."
1481,Great product,Love it!  Especially that you can add water from the top without having to take it off the base.
1482,The best I've ever .....,"Wow!  After using all kinds of humidifiers, this one by far is the best.  Top loading makes it easy to fill, quiet operation that I never really hear, and plenty of choices for humidity."
1483,Hoof,Hood
1484,Good,Very good humidifier.  May get another one for bedroom.
1485,A very important item to keep body¡¯s respiratory system in good condition in winter heating!,"We put this in our bedroom and close the door at night so the humidity stays about 40 to 45 %.  That keeps our nose  from being dry and bleeding,  our skin does not feel itchy and dry also during the furnace heating all winter long.
This is very easy to fill at the kitchen sink and last over 24 hours on automatic.  I have had this since January 7 and just cleaned it yesterday which was also easy to do.  This is a must during winter and a very good buy!"
1486,Great humidifier,"Okay, I confess I don't care about the wifi feature. So, I have no idea if that's a good/bad feature on this model.
But, as an actual humidifier, this is the JAM. It's super easy to clean, fill, is very quiet, and it's possible to easily turn off all lighting on the unit. The only thing I'll say is that the guage for in room humidity is always a little off since the guage is on the unit itself. Of course the room will be at a lesser percentage humidity the further from the unit you get. I have a separate little guage, and let me tell you, this humidifier ACTUALLY increases the humidity in the air greatly unlike other units I've had. It's pretty great."
1487,Shuts off,"Shuts off several times a day. I have to unplug it, plug it back in and then reset the settings.

This machine is useless."
1488,Love it,It¡¯s so cool. My daughter loves the fact that she can control it with an app. It has to stay at about 61% otherwise the floor will be wet in the morning but besides that no Complaints. No Noise or issues. I use filtered water.
1489,Overheated on the First Tank of Water,"Wanted to love the humidifier. However, as mentioned also by some other reviewers, I encountered an overheat issue. My unit overheated just by the third night and only half a tank of water was used. Water was VERY warm the next day and no steam was being generated. Felt extremely unsafe and decided to return immediately."
1490,12 hours on low mist,Doesn¡¯t last 60 hours.
1491,Humidity reading,"Avalon seems to be more accurate on the humidity level reading. Levoid is giving a 56, Avalon 40 and my Vicks hygrometer is saying 34RH at 66¡ãF"
1492,Great product!,"Great product so far! Easy fill, quiet and strong mist"
1493,The best humidifier!,"I recently bought a hygrometer to see the humidity levels in my apartment during the winter. It has been nearly 32% humidity all month so I bought this humidifier to help with the dry air. This one is the perfect humidifier for the price. It has a large enough tank to fill occasionally, the noise is not too loud that it keeps you up, and we have not had to worry about the carpet whenever we have it on low or medium. We did have an issue when we set it to high-- we woke up and the carpet was damp. So if you really need to put it on high, I recommend you put it up on something, ontop of a towel. However, it definitely raises the humidity in my bedroom and I use it almost every night. I highly recommend this humidifier!"
1494,Dead on arrival,I just took it out of the box.  It doesn't work at all.
1495,Works As Described! (Rare nowadays!),"This is a GREAT humidifier. It's an upgrade to our last one which broke in a move. We have a smaller one from the same brand and it worked so nice I decided to stay loyal to the company. The auto features are nice! I sometimes set it to start automatically in the morning so I don't wake up to a totally dry living room. It's whisper-quiet, seriously can't even hear it. The ability to add water in at the top is AWESOME. And it is large enough that it raises the humidity in our living space. We tried the smaller one (from the bedroom) and it didn't make a dent in the humidity. This one works well!"
1496,It definitely is whisper quiet,"We love it ... we were able to figure out how to install and use the App and the humidifier. We have noticed a difference right away in the humidity in our bedroom - for the better - although we are not yet getting the humidity (in our large bedroom) over 30%. The night light is a bit too bright but really, we are very happy with this purchase."
1497,Won't connect to WIFI,"I bought 2 of these and I actually copied another review because its identical to what I was going to write. "" got the Levoit Classic 300S humidifier because of its smart functions to connect with my Alexa. However, it is IMPOSSIBLE to make it connect to my 2.4 GHz wifi network. I've tried everything, like disabling my 5 GHz, network, disabling the firewall, bringing the device closer to the router, etc. It simply won't connect.

Through the VeSync app, I'm able to connect and find the humidifier through a Bluetooth connection. But then when the app prompts me to log in to my wifi network. After choosing my networking and inputting my credentials, the app runs for 36 seconds and then it crashes. IT'S SO FRUSTRATING.""
I have sent a support ticket asking for assistance so I will wait to see what happens but may end up sending back to Amazon unfortunately. Why have the technology if you can't utilize it."
1498,Humidifier Remedies Itching Skin!,"This humidifier is just the thing to remedy itching skin from dry, desert air!"
1499,Updated review,"Got this item today. Been trying out various humidifiers this winter with bad luck so far, and really hoping this slightly more expensive model does the trick. Here are my impressions so far in the first couple hours, and I¡¯ll update this review as time passes if I have additional findings.

The unit is easy to set up and pair with Bluetooth. The warranty registration is straightforward.

It¡¯s super quiet and easy to fill. The display is bright and easy to see, even from across the room. The app is user friendly and intuitive, and I was able to easily set to my target humidity level. I like that I can rotate the nozzle to direct the mist in the direction of my choosing. I like that night mode turns off the bright display. I like that it doesn¡¯t beep at all.

It seems like it will be easy to clean, though not as easy as some round units I¡¯ve tried. Those got sent back for beeping while sleeping, and not having effective enough output to raise humidity levels, respectively. I wish this one had a round tank like those did, but oh well.

I don¡¯t think the humidistat is super accurate, according to my hygrometer, but that¡¯s also somewhat to be expected. It¡¯s a matter then of how far apart the readings are and how consistent they are.

The unit so far says it¡¯s 5-10% more humid than what my hygrometer reads in the same room. Right now for example the base says 40% and the hygrometer about 6 feet away says 33%. This could cause issues because the instructions say that auto mode shuts off when the base reaches 50%. So that could be a problem if there¡¯s a disparity of 10% or more with the base shutting off before the space actually reaches the 40% minimum that I¡¯m aiming for.

That said, I¡¯ll need to give it a few days of use before I can form a solid opinion. I also am in my living room right now, which I expect to have a different performance than my bedroom which is much smaller and closed off from the rest of the house. I expect humidity to collect more efficiently in the bedroom.

If I have to run the unit on manual during the day in the living room to get it in the 40s, that¡¯s fine, as long as I can count on auto in my bedroom while I¡¯m sleeping and maintain humidity in the 40s. I¡¯ll update this review as I observe the unit¡¯s performance in various circumstances.

--------

Been running this at night for several nights now, and overall am pleased. It's not consistent with my hygrometer, but it's consistent with itself. Meaning if I want it to go up to 45% in the room, I have to set the unit to 55%. It works well in nighttime mode and is quiet."
1500,Super Quiet and Refined Humidifier,"I like the clean design and love the humidifier's multiple easy to use (very logical) features. I am not a tech savvy person and would have be happy with the humidifier's manual controls, however downloading the Vesync app was easy and using my iphone allows me to remotely schedule days, hours and levels of desired humidity, etc. And I was pleasantly surprised how quiet the humidifier is even on high mist, and no hum or gurgling that I found disturbing with previous humidifiers. Kudos to Levoit for providing a premium engineered humidifier with all the latest features and at a very reasonable price."
1501,Very hard to clean,"Our unit does not leak like some of the other reviews have noted. It is however very hard to clean. After about a week of use an orange moldy substance covers all of the hard to reach spaces. Soaking in vinegar helps but the small hard to reach spaces still have to be scrubbed clean. A small brush is provided but it doesn¡¯t do the trick. There is one spot that can¡¯t be reached at all. I got tired of changing the filters on my old unit but that was a breeze compared to this one. On the plus side it is quiet and easy to fill. Oh, and a white dust covers everything in the room after a day or two of use. As soon as the cold weather ends this unit is going in the trash."
1502,"Effective product, well worth its price!","We purchased this humidifier after much deliberation as we were unaware of the Levoit brand and whether it would meet our needs. Now after few weeks of use, we would gladly recommend this product to anyone looking to purchase a humidifier!
The tank has a large capacity, and lasts us 24 hrs for our 1000sqft apartment. Sometimes the apartment looks cloudy from all the vapor, but thats how we know its working!
It is easy to clean and due to the wide top opening it can be scrubbed with good ol soap and water into all corners! The tiny slots on the edges are such a smart idea as all the water is emptied out when turned upside down - my favorite feature about this device.
The display shows the humidity level in the room, which we see falling when the heater blows air or the windows are open. It also pairs with Alexa and can be voice controlled to set the humidity, turn on/off its light and schedule.
Compared to other products in this price range I feel this one has many features and is worth thr price."
1503,Runs for about two days on high.," The main reason I got this is because I hated that my other humidifier, by the same company, only lasted for a few hours before it was dry and then I'd have to keep on refilling it throughout the day. This one lasts for about two days before I have to refill it, on the high setting. It's nice to have the WiFi function though I won't likely need it since I'm running it all the time to keep my plants happy. The auto function doesn't seem to make it come on at all, and I've got very low humidity (20%). It's super easy to top fill with a pitcher and it's perfectly silent."
1504,Do Not Buy!!,"First off, it puts out no more mist than much cheaper humidifiers.  However much worse is that when I tried to opt-out of ¡°sharing¡± my information with ¡°partners¡± it took 15 minutes finding out how (why I wasted my time...).  Once there the instruction was to send a letter, snail mail.  I think the policy and hiding of it stinks and although not deceptive tells me to walk the other way."
1505,Piercing white noise on low and medium mist setting,I really like this humidifier and all of its features but there is a high pitched white noise that I¡¯m hearing when the mist level is set to low or medium. I am not hearing it on auto or high. It is piercing to my ears and I can¡¯t stand to hear it so I will be returning it but otherwise it works great. I especially love the wifi and smart features and that it detects the humidity of the room. I wish I could keep it.
1506,Wifi won't connect,"I got the Levoit Classic 300S humidifier because of its smart functions to connect with my Alexa. However, it is IMPOSSIBLE to make it connect to my 2.4 GHz wifi network. I've tried everything, like disabling my 5 GHz, network, disabling the firewall, bringing the device closer to the router, etc. It simply won't connect.

Through the VeSync app, I'm able to connect and find the humidifier through a Bluetooth connection. But then when the app prompts me to log in to my wifi network. After choosing my networking and inputting my credentials, the app runs for 36 seconds and then it crashes. IT'S SO FRUSTRATING.

I opened a ticket with Levoit but did not get any updates or feedback so far. I will return it to Amazon."
1507,The BEST humidifier We've Ever Bought,"The winter air is very dry and that is not good for our nine parrots or us. We bought this humidifier based on others' recommendations and since we bought our 1st, we have bought 2 more. The moisture in the air is almost instantly noticable. The birds are more calm (their skin gets dry also under all those feathers). Absolutely recommend this machine on functionality alone, but the remote features are amazing also!!!!"
1508,Finally a smart humidifier that works!,"Finally a smart humidifier that works! I¡¯ve gone through three smart humidifiers trying to find one that works. This humidifier is so quiet and easy to operate and being able to fill the tank from the top is a nice added bonus. Lastly, the app works great and was easy to set up. I¡¯ve had issues in the past with smart humidifiers and apps that just did not work. I¡¯m very satisfied with this purchase and would highly recommend it."
1509,"Very pleased - nice size, easy to refill","I was so pleased with the first humidifier I ordered that I ordered a second of the same model. I love that the tank is big and that it can be refilled from the top without removing the tank from the unit. I bought a 1-gallon plastic pitcher and use that to refill it, which is so much easier and cleaner than removing the tank, dripping water all over, turning it upside down, trying to fit it under the tap in the sink, flipping it back over when it's full and heavy, dripping more water all over, then trying to get it situated back on the unit.

I've had one unit running full steam non-stop  in my living room and the other in my bedroom for a couple weeks now. I have a large living room with a lofted ceiling, but this unit still does a good job of maintaining the humidity around 30-40%, which is so much more comfortable and healthy the the usual 15-20% I have in the winter.

It's whisper quiet. The digital display is very bright, but it has a function to turn it off so the light doesn't keep me awake at night."
1510,Great humidifier for larger spaces,"Super quiet, emits a lot of vapor, great for large rooms. Easy to use."
1511,Exactly the humidifier I needed,"Large capacity, nearly silent, and one-button setup.

I bought this to replace a series of failed-after-one-season cheap Wal-Mart humidifiers.
I'm impressed by how quiet it is, and how easy it is to fill and operate."
1512,a great stream of mist,What I like about this product is that you can set it for different levels of mist.  And the stronger mist is very large and it's quiet.  It's a good product.
1513,Works great,Very large chamber to hold water. I use filtered water and a charcoal filter and that's kept the cleaning down to minimal. I like the app with it. It let's me know when it's empty and I can change the about from low to high. There's an auto feature but I can't set what I want the percentage to be. It's auto set for a target area of 50%. It will shut off after 5% above the target and start 5% below the target.  I personally would like it to be 45% as the target area
1514,WiFi and top fill are great,"I love the WiFi and app features as it's great to see what the humidity level is by not having to go and check the machine itself (on another floor of the house). Having schedule and timer options are great as well.
The large, top fill is great for refilling as you don't have to take the tank off to fill.
Highly recommend this brand and will buy more."
1515,I love it!,"This humidifier is perfect! I love it.. and love it has the essential oil option too! Works amazing, very powerful! I recommend it"
1516,"Great humidifier when it works, the customer service is good when it leaks.","There¡¯s app to schedule time to turn on or shut down. It can also set humidity level. Easy to clean, parts can be cleaned separately. Powerful enough for large room. It worked awesome when it worked... Although... It started to leak after less then three months of use... a lot of water was leaked though between the tank and the base, all over the table and the floor... I contacted the customer service of Levoit, they quickly responded sent a replacement units along with a prepaid shipping label for me to ship the leaking one back. The new one work fine go far. I must say the customer service is great!"
1517,So easy to refill and very effective and quiet,"I¡¯ve had humidifiers before and this one is so much easier to refill and clean.  It makes no noise and blows out a steady superfine mist.  I like seeing the digital humidity percentage and it is easy to adjust the output level: automatic, low, medium and high. Also has a night light and a aroma wick where you can add a few drops of essential oil to (very) lightly sent while the humidifier is in operation.  Nice slick design and well made.  Highly recommend."
1518,Runny Nose Gone!,The app is very convenient for us lazy folks lol you can control everything right from your phone! I love how it adjusts automatically to the right ideal room temperature! Bought it for my sons runny nose and i ran it at night for 1 week with oil and it¡¯s gone! I compared A LOT of humidifiers and i¡¯m glad i bought this one!
1519,Quiet,I purchased one for myself and my son. We both love them!  Quiet and does the job.  I'm using mine in our bedroom and it's been helping with allergies.
1520,"Easy to use,  customizable,  great app, large Tank size.","One of the quietest humidifier I have had.  This is a really smart humidifier with great features.
Noise: It is very quiet. I can barely hear anything unless I put my ear next to it.

Nozzle: The nozzle for the humidifier is adjustable. You can point it in any direction that you want. This is great if you want it to point in a specific direction.

Controls: This is my favorite part of this humidifier.  The buttons on the humidifier are very easy to use.  I prefer the app. I downloaded the app, pressed the power button for 5 seconds and then I paired the humidifier to my app. It was quick and easy.  Once paired I was able to control my humidifier using my app.
I can set a timer so the humidifier can turn off in 1 or any specific duration i want.
I also set a schedule so the humidifier will turn on every day at a specific time and turn off in the morning at a specific time. This is great if you want it only when you sleep. You set it once and you are done.
The other good setting is the Auto setting.  You set a specific humidity and that's it.  It will humidify 5 above your setting and then wait until it drops below to turn on again.  This way you will never over humidify. You can use auto mode when you set your schedule a well.
You also can turn on a night light of needed.
You can also turn off the control light on the humidifier so that you can have prefect darkness if light is of concern.

Tank size: Tank size is huge but still easy to fill and carry.  Handles on both side to help carry.  Wide openings to clean the Tank and fill. I am hoping with schedule and auto mode this humidifier will last a week on full Tank.

If you are looking for a smart humidifier for a great price this is it. The App is one of the easiest to use and has all the features you need. You will definitely love this."
1521,Great humidifier!,I bought this item because my heater at home is blowing very dry air. I was tired to wake up with dry nose. As soon as I bought this humidifier and placed it next to my bed the issue was solved!
1522,Not worth the money,I used this humidifier for 2 nights the humidity in the room stayed at 39% despite being at the highest level. I called Amazon support to troubleshoot. There help consisted of ¡°did you plug it in¡± and ¡°did you put water in it?¡± Come on. A waste of money.
1523,works beautifully,"I love this product. it works with hardly any attention from me, comes on automatically, does it's thing and shuts off, or I can use my phone to turn it on. I would highly recommend this...;"
1524,Not as advertised,300s Quiet and easy to use but doesn¡¯t support up to 500 square feet.  Would not recommend.  I bought a 200s to go along and it helps but still not great.  Force is mist is poor even on high setting.  6L supposed to last 60 hours but I¡¯m lucky even with not running all day but only morning and evening if I can get away with 48 hours of runtime.  Better than nothing but not worth the hassle to mess with setting all the time.  At least it can be done with app.
1525,Quiet and efficient,Works great. Settings in app are not what I thought they would be. After connecting to Alexa and setting it up in that app I was able to fine tune the settings.
1526,Buy it,"So far I¡¯m loving this humidifier. The touch buttons are great and it¡¯s really quiet (don¡¯t even hear it over my fan which runs constantly). The nozzle is fully directional which I LOVE as my prior humidifier was limited to a 180 position.
The tank is super easy to fill and on low lasts a while before needing to be refilled. I¡¯m very happy with my purchase."
1527,BEST HUMIDIFIER EVER,"I have 5 humidifiers, really!  This is by far the best one I have ever had.  I love the top fill, wifi and IT IS SO QUIET!!!  I really can't hear it!"
1528,"No wasted money on filters, great, quiet cool mist humidifier","This was easy to set up and get going. I only use distilled water so less hard water buildup to clean. Out of the box and running via the cellphone app in less than about 10 minutes. Works great, nice night light feature with two brightness settings or off setting, low/med/high mist settings, a place in the back of the unit to put scented oils (do not add to water), and a directional valve to change the direction of the mist on top. Holds about 2 gallons of water and lasts for days depending on your desired humidity % level. You can set automatic or manual control in the app which is nice. On auto setting, the unit will auto off at a set humidity % level that you want. It's great. Worth the money. May buy another here soon."
1529,LOVE IT! MADE it part of my Good Night Routine!,"I live in the dry Arizona desert. My old one died after a rambunctious dog and cat chase at 3 am. My old one wasn't that old, yet I couldn't find it to replace it. So after too much time spent reading what each one did and what decibel the noise was, I was amused when this product said it worked with Alexa. This product was set up in about 45 seconds! Simple to add to the existing Good Night Routine. It holds enough water to run on for 3-4 days in Arizona. It runs about 16 hours a day thanks to Covid-19 stay at home orders.  When the stay-at-home orders are finished it will probably hold water for a full week with its large tank."
1530,Shuts off constantly,Worked ok for the first day. Now it just shuts off randomly for no reason. The red water fill light comes on randomly even though it has a full tank of water and then the device just shuts off. Other times it will run for maybe 2-3 minutes and then shut off even though it's not even close to the set humidity level. This seems to be a fairly common issue based on other reviews. I have a Levoit air purifier that I love but unfortunately this is going back.
1531,These really work,They put a lot of water into the air if on high so be careful to turn them down unless you like high humidity.
1532,Awesome!!!,"Stopped my wife , mine, and two dogs dry mouth problems, .......slept much much better affect was dramatic improvement of sleep ..... for all..... best health purchase I¡¯ve made in years!!!!!"
1533,Love it! Quiet and low profile,"I bought this humidifier after returning another 'highly rated' one. I love it.
It's VERY quiet, doesn't take up a ton of space and has cool features. It's easy to fill up -- 2 handles makes it easy to carry to sink.
 I love that you can turn off the display at night (night mode), but note that when you do it automatically switches to ""auto"" mode. I wish they did give you the choice to still have whatever you want in night mode (low, med, high) and not just auto.
Also, the auto default is a humidity around 50%. The only way to change that is to download and use the VeSync app on your phone. I didn't want another app, but did use it to change the default humidity level. I think it's a little misleading because the humidity level recorded right at the machine is higher than it is in the room in general, so I set my default higher to 55% to account for that."
1534,This is a smart machine that helps me breathe easier!,"This is so easy to use - it was simple to set up, easier to fill than any other humidifier I¡¯ve purchased in the past. I love that you can put it on a timer so that it goes on as I prepare to go to sleep and turns off when I get up in the morning and that it turns off if it achieves the appropriate levels of humidity in your space. It¡¯s a wonderful device!"
1535,Auto feature awesome,"I liked this so much I bought a second one. My previous humidifier made the room so humid it was like a sauna. This one has a feature that automatically adjusts to maintain optimal humidity. It has high, medium, and low setting also. I also like the auto off feature, so it won¡¯t keep running it it runs out of water. Oh, it is very quiet."
1536,Humidifier,Puts out a lot of mist to increase humidity
1537,Nearly perfect,"It's great except the little aromatherapy slot in the back is just a pad you can put a few drops of essential oils into.  More than that and it leaks onto the floor.  That's fine, because I didn't buy it for that.
It would have been great though.
Does ~500 sq ft"
1538,Great value for the money,"We bought this product to humidity our great room. It has very quiet operation and I like being able to see instantaneous humidity levels. No problems so far.
The only caveat is that I turned the unit on to AUTO mode and despite the room humidity remaining under 40 percent, it never kicked into a high mode to bring the humidity up. I had to manually set the mist level (which is no big deal), but I did think that AUTO mode should be just that - automatic."
1539,Won¡¯t work without WiFi,Don¡¯t buy this unless you intend to control it with the app.  It will not even turn on unless you connect to the WiFi in your home.
1540,Ease of use,No noise at all and easy to refill.
1541,VeSync app,My third humidifier (used for cigars) the best so far .. the smart feature is the best thing.. I can check/adjust the humidity anytime!
1542,Humidifier,Easy to fill. Works great. App allows your phone to be the remote.
1543,Good value.,Very straightforward setup. Typical fussy connection to Alexa. Not a big deal. Puts out a lot of mist quickly. Works as advertised.
1544,Emits unpleasant odor.,Works BEAUTIFULLY but smells. Used distilled water. Cleaned with Vinegar on 5 th day because of odor. Ordered bacteria sticks still smells VERY unpleasant. Makes you not want to use it.
1545,Great humidifier,"Worked great , no more dry mouth or nose in the morning.Great"
1546,Easy to clean daily.,"Finally, a design that makes cleaning quick.  It's quiet and easy to use.  I didn't use the app feature.  Works perfectly."
1547,So quiet and easy to use!,"My first Levoit Classic 300S arrived Monday.  We put it in the bedroom with lavender essential oil - wonderful!  Getting out of the cozy bed was even more difficult.  Tuesday, I ordered another for the living room (balsam fir oil).  The Levoit is inexpensive, intuitive, and connects effortlessly to VeSync and Alexa (I don¡¯t think they both can connect to Alexa, but I may be mistaken.). They are so quiet, and it may be my imagination, but the air feels cleaner!  Too new to have cleaned yet, but I¡¯m confident it will be easy.  Highly recommend!!"
1548,Could have been a great product,"Great idea, incredibly poor execution. Hard to clean the lots of small areas and a silly little brush. App design looks great but doesn't function at all. Firmware update failed. Humidifier does not connect to network nor can it be setup in app. Product will be returned. Don't waste your time with this product."
1549,"Easy to use, smart app, top fill!","This humidifier is so easy to set up and use. I love the smart app. It downloaded, installed, and easily connected to the humidifier so I can control it with my Apple devices. I¡¯m using the humidifier in my 860 sq ft apartment, and the humidity level is remaining constant with the Auto setting. The top fill feature is a must¡ªno more lifting and trying to turn over a heavy container full of water."
1550,Working great!,"I bought 4 humidifiers in total.
TaoTronics humidifiers, HoMedics TotalComfort and this one.
There is no other humidifier with smart feature (app controllable) except this brand."
1551,Humidifier is Quiet and Top Fill and Remember to Read the Instruction Manual,"Having a humidifier that can be filled from the top saves carrying a heavy tank. I also appreciate how quiet the humidifier is. I did have some water leaking from the humidifier, but it was my own fault. In the instruction manual it did say to remove the tank when moving the humidifier. I had been moving the humidifier from my family room to my bedroom without removing the tank. I hadn't read that instruction ahead of time so had some water on the table and floor. I bought a second humidifier so I can have one in my bedroom and one in my family room and not have to worry about water spilling from the humidifier."
1552,Worked less then 12 hours,"Disappointing... Waited over 2 weeks to get and it only worked 12 hours.

I ordered on December, 19 2020 and didn't receive the humidifier till January, 6 2021. Filled it with water, plugged it in, turn it on, and setup the WIFI. It worked great, good stream of mist coming out, everything looked good. About 12 hours later I didn't see any mist anymore but it was still on and set to high. I took the cover off the water tank and look inside it was trying to mist but did not seem to have the power to do it.

We will see if the replacement is any better?"
1553,Just excellent. Will recommend to my friends.,"I had humidifiers of different kinds before. All had some flaws: noisy, flimsy, small water tank etc. I was not sure if i really need this model, what if it will be the same? How much was i surprised!
Solid plastic, not cheap clanky, transparent bowl, easy to setup with application (and w/o it), controlled from Alexa application, large display
Many thanks to Levoit! Will buy one or two more for other rooms. Can recommend to anyone."
1554,Great first impressions for the top fill 6L model,"This review is for the grey top fill 6L model. I received the device today 1/4/21 and have already started using it. The only prep you need before using it is to peel away the 2 shipping tape pieces on each side of the tank to remove the shipping foam that surrounds the float (under the tank). I removed the foam and retapped the tank to avoid accidental tank removal. I¡¯m only using purified water, never use tap water!

The good:
- IT¡¯S TOP FILL!!! I can¡¯t begin to express how much this matters. With this design there¡¯s no more removing the tank, flipping it over, filling it, flipping it over again and reinserting.
- The mist flow is great
- The app integration is easy to set up
- The app allows you to turn off the display. This is great for those who have light sensitivity issues to sleep at night.
- Noise level is very quiet, nothing noticeable and should not keep anyone awake at night.
- The nightlight has a low/high/off option

The bad:
- So far there are no obvious issues.

Potential Future Enhancements:
- Nightlight: It¡¯s currently a 3000k (meaning it¡¯s yellowish in color) light. It would of been better to have a 5000k (daylight white) light, or even the ability to change the nightlight¡¯s color to the user¡¯s preference via the app.
- Water Level Meter: It would be great to see the current water level via the app with a option to have a notification sent when water is low. Today, you can¡¯t see the water level via the app, the user needs to physically look at the tank.

This is a non-sponsored review, please like if you found it useful. Thanks!!"
1555,Water leaking from humidifier,"Started leaking on very first day so going to return it, water on the floor damaged my smart LED lights as well. In past I never had any complaints with Levoit but this this time didn¡¯t like it at all.

On Good side its smart humidifier so you can turn on and off using smart assistants."
1556,Caused water damage,"Plunger failed and leaked the entire contents into the floor, water damage is great"
1557,humidity meter seems to be off,"considering returning it, because humidity monitor on that humidifier shows way higher humidity than others in that area"
1558,"Best-designed humidifier ever, and connected too","This is hands down the best designed humidifier I've ever owned, and I'm in my sixties. The connected feature means one rarely has to touch the unit once it's set up  except to refill the water and clean it every once in a while. I had no trouble connecting to the VeSync app and then bridging over to Alexa. The built-in humidistat (?) ensures that the target humidity level (between 40-50%) will automatically be maintained without the unit having to steam constantly. The noise level is truly whisper-quiet. Being able to fill the tank from the top is another nice touch and my back will be grateful for that."
1559,Excellent Humidifier / Wifi App Failure,"This humidifier provides very quiet operation, digital controls and easy top access for water refills.  If the Vesync app had worked - this would be a five star review.
Note: This is a cool mist humidifier that recommends distilled water - so you will be buying distilled water or cleaning often.  Vesync support is helpful but after numerous attempts, we just gave up.  The app could not find our network - but could find other wifi network connections.  Vesync is providing a gift card... Good support.

Update 12/29:  The VeSnyc SUPPORT is OUTSTANDING - the support team, continued to reach out and make suggestions - and today the VeSync App is working!  This is quality product with exceptional customer service!"
1560,Coverage debateable,"It says it can cover 700sf, we had it in our bedroom 300sf. We couldn't hardly get it to put out more than 35%, even with all the settings on high."
1561,Best humidifier I've ever owned,"This humidifier is quite simply the best I've tried. This winter, I've ordered and returned about 10 different ultrasonic (filter-less) humidifiers, ranging from Vicks to Taotronics, to other off name brands I've never heard of but they had good reviews on Amazon. I've finally found this humidifier which meets all my needs. I must have a unit that is quiet when it comes to sounds, has a good mist output, fills from the top of the tank, and is easy to clean. This Levoit exceeds all.

My last few humidifiers of various brands all created a sound of some kind. I've tried two other top fill types, but they were constantly making a water dripping sound, like a fast dripping faucet in a sink. This is caused by water condensation at the top of the mist tube dripping back down into the base reservoir. This Levoit has a multilayered bottom on the mist tube which diverts the water drops from dripping straight down into the water, thus creating the noise. And being a top fill tank, you don't have to unscrew a lid and turn it upside down to fill. These types create a loud ""gurgling"" sound usually every 30 min to an hour. This unit does not have any of those GULP GULP GULP sounds that wake you up.

The tank is top filled, so it has a VERY large opening on the top making it easy to get your hand in there to clean it. Again, bottom filled tanks are harder to clean because the only opening you can get your hand into is the lid that you unscrew to fill the tank. This tank also has another clever modification to it on the top of the tank. It has slits in each corner which means when you turn it upside down to empty the old water, any water trapped in the corners have a way to empty out.

So being literally, completely silent (including water noises) and having a easy to clean, top fill tank makes this the number 1 for me. The only thing I would mention now that may help you is this: you should download the app if only to set the default auto humidity settings to higher levels. What I mean is, at night, when you press the sleep button to turn off the LED display but to keep the unit running as you sleep, pressing it turns the unit to ""auto"" mode."" The default problem with this is that if the unit detects humidity levels above 40%, it auto shuts off. 40% to me is too low, so I had to use the app and set the auto goal to a 60% humidity. That way it's not constantly cutting off at night on sleep mode. You can ONLY do this with the app. But this minor, one time fix is not near enough for me to mark this down. Best ultrasonic, cool mist humidifier there is for under $100."
1562,leaked water all over my floor,"Like other reviewers, I was happy with this humidifier at first, but on just the second tank fill, this unit leaked water all over my floor. I took the tank out, filled it with some water, and put it in a pan to check for leaks. Sure enough, the valve circled in the attached pic had a steady drip. This is the valve that is pushed open by the float in the unit's base when more water is needed in the bottom; it's supposed to be closed when the base is full. The leak causes the base to overfill and leak out of the unit. The valve is pretty flimsy and clearly a weak link in this unit. It's going back, and I do not recommend."
1563,Best humidifier I have owned,"I have two humidifiers for my house plants and orchids. This one is by far my favorite one. I love that it connects through wifi. We will see how it works when I go away for a week. I am hoping I can still connect to it and turn it on. It would have been great if it detected water levels on the app as well. The app is very easy to use and the setup was easy as well. I also love that it is top filling. My other one is bottom filling and is a pain to refill. The Levoit humidifier is so easy to refill and less messy.  It is also very quiet compared to my other one. It also has a movable nozzle on the top so you can direct the mist in whichever direction you want. I love the auto feature and how you can set it to the humidity you want. I know this review is all over the place. I am just so happy with my purchase _ My other humidifier is a very well known brand name in the USA, and you would think it would be better, but it doesn't even compare to the Levoit."
1564,Water lasts 2 days,Control by Alexa works great
1565,Moisture in the air,Works as advertised
1566,Documentation Needs Updating,"I discovered that the LEVOIT humidifier works in ranges.  If I set the goal humidity to 40% it will go as low as 35 and as high as 45 without turning back on/off.  This confused me and at first I thought it was broken.  Otherwise, this machine has been working great so far."
1567,Don't bother with any other humidifier,"I love this thing! It was super easy to set up, the Alexa hook up was also very simple, so the only thing I have to do is remember to fill it. I LOVE THAT IT FILLS FROM THE TOP!  The other humidifier I have is a bottom fill and although its not terrible, its just way less convenient. This one is the best."
1568,It is so wonderfully quiet.,We use it to elevate the humidity in the  living room.
1569,Good value,"Price was good, operates quietly, easy to operate"
1570,Super Luftbefeuchter,Der ist mal echt gut f¨¹r sein Geld. Er hatt ein gro_es Volumen und ist auch mit einer menge Einstellungen best¨¹ckt. Super auch der Timer.
1571,Macht was er soll!,Ich bin soweit zufrieden. Ich konnte das Klima in unserer Wohnung ca 78m_ deutlich verbessern. Er steht im Flur und l_uft tags¨¹ber f¨¹r 6 Stunden was mehr als ausreichend ist. Wir sind mehr als zufrieden.... W¨¹rde ich jederzeit wiederkaufen.
1572,Great unit!,"This was to replace another unit that I had previously.  I love this one way better.  Easy to fill and very quiet. It's in the bedroom so the noise level is very important.  And yes, I am a geek and I really like that it is connected to WiFi.  :-)"
1573,"Wow, meglio di alcune marche balsonatissime","Ottino alleato della qualit¨¢ dell'aria domestica.
Perfetto, completo.
Forse unica pecca il sensore di umidit¨¢ molto ballerino ma per il resto siamo confenti dell'acquisto"
1574,Ottimo,Ottimo prodotto facile da usare
1575,Sehr leise,"Sehr leiser und sehr effizienter Luftbefeuchter. Leicht zu bef¨¹llen. Nur destilliertes oder Osmosewasser nehmen, sonst schl_gt sich Kalk auf den M_beln nieder, aber das ist eigentlich logisch und daf¨¹r kann das Ger_t nichts."
1576,Alles bestens,Prompte Lieferung. Genau wie beschrieben. Lautloser Betrieb. Kann problemlos im Schlafzimmer betrieben werden. Wir sind begeistert
1577,Nach 8 Wochen defekt,Wurde mit entkalktem Wasser betrieben ist aber bereits nach 8 Wochen defekt.... Ich bin gespannt wie der Umtausch abl_uft.
1578,Sehr angenehme Raumluft!Top!,"Einfache Bedienung, sehr effizient, schnell merkbar bessere Luft"
1579,Amazing,"Levoit for the win. Love how you can turn the leds of at night, nobody else does that - they all just think you should sleep with your room lit up like an Xmas tree lol. Not levoit, they are the best. Create routines on this, sync and control with phone. Sends cleaning reminders, tells you when the tank is empty. Maintains precise humidity of your choice. It's the best."
1580,Ger_uschlos,Bin sehr zufrieden. Den Artikel ist schnell gekommen und entspricht voll meine Erwartungen. Vielen Dank
1581,nie mehr wieder!!!,"Ich bin entsetzt und sauer.

Wir haben 3 Ger_te gekauft: 1x diesen mit 6l f¨¹r den Wohn-/Essbereich (Erdgeschoss) und 2x mit 3l f¨¹r zwei Schlafr_ume (Obergeschoss).

positiv:
- Verpackung verzichtet fast ganz auf Plastik
- gro_e Einf¨¹ll_ffnungen
- Anschluss an Alexa einfach und problemlos

negativ:
- ¨¹berall, und ich meine wirklich ¨¹berall, nach wenigen Stunden auf Hochbetrieb ein feiner
  grauer/wei_er Schleier. Auf Fenstern, nicht nur auf dem Glastisch sondern auch auf der Unterseite
  der Glasscheibe, Sammlerst¨¹cke in Vitrinen, auf der Ledergarnitur, allen M_beln usw. . Selbst unser
  Luftreiniger hat gestreikt, weil das Filter mit dem feinen wei_en Staub dicht war und der Saugroboter
  brauchte 2 Anl_ufe f¨¹r eine Etage.

Wir haben die Luftbefeuchter mit unserem Leitungswasser, das ¨¹ber eine (funktionierende) Entkalkungsanlage l_uft, gef¨¹llt. Nun hofften wir, dass wenn sich die Luftfeuchtigkeit auf dem gew¨¹nschten Pegel eingerichtet h_tte, sich dieser Belag nicht mehr zeigen w¨¹rde. Die Hoffnung hat sich zerschlagen, das Problem bestand weiterhin.
Und destilliertes Wasser zu nehmen ist aus Preisgr¨¹nden indiskutabel. Wir haben  nach Erreichen des gew¨¹nschten Pegels pro Tag insgesamt ca. 12 l Wasser gebraucht.

F¨¹r uns ist der negative Aspekt so gravierend, dass wir die Ger_te zur¨¹ckgeben."
1582,umidificatore,"ottimo prodotto, facile da usare e programmare con l'app, molto silenzioso , sono molto soddisfatto, lo consiglio"
1583,GRAZIE,
1584,Amazing easy to use good app control,Its amazing love the vapor and app control notifications
1585,Luftfeuchtigkeit wurde wegen offener T¨¹ren nicht erreicht. (Katzenbesitzer),"Der Luftbefeuchter arbeitet sehr leise und lie_ sich auch per App einfach steuern.
Leider wurde bei uns die empfohlene Luftfeuchtigkeit nicht erreicht.
Da wir Katzen haben und die T¨¹r zum Flur meist offen steht.
Das Ger_t lief daher im Dauerbetrieb und die von mir eingestellten 55 % wurden nur kurzzeitig erreicht.
In 2 Tagen haben wir 8L destilliertes Wasser verbraucht, aber eine sp¨¹rbare Verbesserung gab es nicht.
Im Wohnzimmer gegen¨¹ber vom Luftbefeuchter haben wir ein Hygrometer der meist nur zwischen 35 und 45 % anzeigte.
Ich gebe trotzdem 3 Punkte.
Der Luftbefeuchter arbeitet sehr leise und lie_ sich auch per App einfach steuern. Auch Duft_le kann man verwenden.
F¨¹r gr__ere R_ume bzw. f¨¹r Katzenbesitzer (offene T¨¹ren) ist er aber eher nicht geeignet.
Das sollte man vor dem Kauf bedenken."
1586,Super produit MAIS,"Super humidificateur, il r¨¦pond tr¨¨s bien aux attentes de mes plantes tropicales ! Cependant j'utilise exclusivement de l'eau osmos¨¦e pour ¨¦viter le calcaire et autres, pourtant j'ai des alertes toutes les semaines pour effectuer un nettoyage. Je ne pense pas qu'il y est de capteur de ""propret¨¦"", plut_t une minuterie qui se d¨¦clenche apr¨¨s un certain nombre de temps en fonctionnement. Pour ma part, se n'est pas vraiment repr¨¦sentatif de son ¨¦tat de propret¨¦, sinon il est super !"

1592,it works well,"works well
soft touch controls
hard setting up to the wireless controls

just a delivery issue"
1593,Definitely recommend,"My little lovely kitten needs a humid house due to her health condition and last winter, cos of the radiators, it was very dry.... we bought this device and we enjoy using it. It's not loud and the quality is very satisfying.

The only issue is that you need to buy special water. I did not paid attention to this point when I ordered it. If you don't have problem with this issue, it's a great option."
1594,Tr¨¨s bonne appareil,"Je  nettoie l'appareil souvent pour ¨ºtre sur de ne pas avoir de d¨¦p_t de calcaire et que la brume salisse la maison. comme toutes les appareils je crois.

1595,Bad sensor,"It measures humidity wrong. It works for 5 minutes and it ""raised"" humidity by 10%"
1596,Every feature as described is working flawlessly.,"The google assistant integration works flawlessly.

Thoughtful design, and easy to clean too.

From the perspective of features and capacity to price, this unit appears to be the best value on Amazon right now."
1597,Smart,E' molto semplice da utilizzare. Si connette l'umidificatore al wifi cos¨¬ pu¨° offrire il monitoraggio e le varie impostazioni sulla gestione dell'umidit¨¤. Mi sembra la qualit¨¤ prezzo eccellente.

1601,White mineral dust everywhere,"Do yourself a favor and buy the drop in demineralizers and use them twice as often as stated.  Our entire area is completely coated in fine white dust. It is even in the cabinets and pantry. It took us two weeks to realize we needed the demineralizer and even though the demineralizer package says to change the pod monthly, our water is so hard that it really only lasts about two weeks with double the demineralizer pods.  The unit has a smart phone app that is useless to us but the touch pad on the machine is very easy to use. It is silent, very easy to clean, lights can be off and works perfectly other than the dust. The foam filter is very yellow from the minerals in our water and apparently cannot be replaced but it is still soft and pliable, so it is working fine. Two months use now and the only frustration is the dust.  We have doubled up the demineralizers, and just checked the furnace filter.  The amount of mineral deposit is so heavy that  it falls off when the filter is removed.  The furnace needs a deep clean.  Do yourself a favor and pass by on this one."
1602,"facile da usare e molto silenzioso, ¨¨ pi¨´ di un mese che lo uso e non ho ancora avuto problemi!","facile da usare e molto silenzioso, ¨¨ pi¨´ di un mese che lo uso e non ho ancora avuto problemi!"
1603,Fantastic humidifier,"Some reviews wee so so but we still decided to buy it. For us it¡¯s perfect! Works nicely, humidity of the room perfect, easy to use and clean and no noise!"
1604,Works great!!,"Works great for our living room (8x5m)

I also got it to work in home assistant.
I bought this model specifically for using it in home assistant and because of the good reviews.

+: Big tank, silent, clear display, the cats stay away from it, app works great

- : You have to create an account (I read somewhere that a credit card is needed. This is not true!).
If the company takes down the service, the home assistant integration stops working.

All together a great machine!"
1605,Stopped working,Stopped working after 2 weeks now just shuts off on its own after a few minutes no matter what mode.

1608,Humidity level sensor is inaccurate!,Purchased as a replacement for my daughters room. The noise level is moderate. The main annoying issue is that the humidity sensor in not accurate at all. I have a dehumidifier and a humidity reader which both give same readings all over the flat but this always gives a different reading. To be sure I even recently took it into the bathroom after a shower and it gave the exact same reading that it gave in my daughters bedroom which can't be right! I would strongly advice you not to buy this product!
1609,Enjoying,"I really like this, easy to fill because you fill it from the top. I also like adding lavender to the scented oil section. Looks very nice as well"
1610,Really good humidifier,"Super silent, and does a great job. The ¡°white dust¡± is definitely for real, so I recommend distilled water if you don¡¯t want to clean that up occasionally ¡ª but, it¡¯s not really that bad. It¡¯s a bit high in price for what it is, but it¡¯s still a good product."
1611,"Ich besitze das ger_t erst wenige Wochen, es funktioniert bisher problemlos.",Die trockene Raumluft wird  wunschgem__ auf die empfohlene Feuchtigkeit angehoben.
1612,Wow,"I've been using the humidifier for about a month and a half now (I use distilled water) and it seriously improved my skin's moisture level. I no longer wake up with redness on my face. Love, love, love it."
1613,Needs the ancient 2.4 GHz for the app to work,Needs the ancient 2.4 GHz for the app to work. Who still uses 2.4 GHz on their router?!
1614,It's Great,"I'm not one to review this kind of stuff usually. This says what it does and does what it says. The ""auto"" feature is something im reluctant to use on any given piece of equipment, tbh, rarely does it work, and if it does, it never works well. This is not the case with the humidifier i received. I use the auto mode all the time.now. Just set it, fill it up, keep it full, but generally forget it and I LOVE THAT. i have an air quality monitor in my home, and i can see that what is showing up on the humidifier is very close to the accurate measurement, if not spot-on. That's huge. Good job on this. It's not super easy to clean, it gives false ""humidifier needs cleaning"" alerts, it makes a quietish digitally shrill noise that i hate, but it's tucked into a corner of the room and the higher the level of humidification it's set to, the less prominent the sound is.

All in all, i give it a 8.3/10
Very, very, solid."
1615,Si scollega sempre dall'app,"Facile da usare e molto silenzioso, la prima settimana ¨¨ stato perfetto, adesso invece si disconnette sempre dall'app e pertanto non riesco ad utilizzare le funzioni, come il controllo dell'umidit¨¤ o il timer che manualmente non si possono fare. Sto valutando restituzione... Peccato!"
1616,Love it!,"This humidifier is so quiet, unless you¡¯re looking at it, you would think it¡¯s not working.
Does the trick.Compact and easy to use and clean.
Very happy with it!"
1617,It does exactly what it promise,"This humidifier do everything right. It is quiet, it has automatic mode, and it has night mode which can be controlled through mobile app. I use it with distilled water."

1620,"OK Google, allume l'humidificateur","Enfin un humidificateur intelligent, je l'ai cherch¨¦ et attendu longtemps.  Il maintient un taux d'humidit¨¦ constant dans la pi¨¨ce et fonctionne juste aux heures souhait¨¦es.  Remplissage facile, belle apparence."
1621,Nice device but incorrect humidity detection,"Current humidity = 45, in the settings it is 50, but when the device is just turned on, it shows 65-66 and does not work. If you turn on the high mode, the sensor starts to show 65-63-60-57-55. So, when the humidifier is turned on, the humidity decreases. This is ridiculous!"
1622,"Gutes Produkt,  gut zu reinigen.  App Bedienung komfortabel.  Habe zwei gekauft.",Siehe Titel
1623,Slight mechanical hum when sitting closeby,Works well only complaint is the noise that it puts off when you¡¯re sitting close by. It annoys be to be frank but you can tune it out eventually. Love the big tank for less refilling and love how it connected seamlessly to my smart home.
1624,Humidificador excelente.,"Humidificador excelente, es de bajo nivel de ruido  f¨¢cil de usar con la aplicaci¨®n mencionada en el instructivo, desde celular se controla lo que necesites, compatible con alexa."
1625,Excellent product,"We are very pleased with this humidifier. It is absolutely noiseless, easy to add water and does a great job. We highly recommend."
1626,"Nice humidifier , aroma part works  okayish","Really awesome product. I had problem of cough and sneezing due to extreme dryness throughout the night as heater was running .
Now I sleep like a baby .
Aroma diffuser works for some time after adding the drops but after an hour there ia not much of aroma left."
1627,Gutes Produkt,"Bedienung des Ger_tes ist sehr einfach, die App-Funktion finde ich sehr praktisch. Einstellungen sind leicht verst_ndlich. Lediglich die Messung der Luftfeuchtigkeit finde ich etwas ungenau (Vergleich mit analogem Ger_t, Abweichung ca. 10%), liegt aber vermutlich daran, dass die Feuchtigkeit in Reichweite sowieso h_her ausf_llt. Alles in allem bin ich zufrieden!"
1628,Justo lo que buscaba,Lo utilizo para generar m¨¢s humedad en la habitaci¨®n donde tengo plantas tropicales exigentes con el nivel alto de humedad. Tiene gran capacidad.
1629,Works Great!,This humidifier works great.  Doesn't make much noise.  We have over 600 Sq feet open space and keeps the level at about 40 - 42.  It would do better if our space was smaller.
1630,Makes a dusty mess,"The mist dropped a film of dust all over the table, wall and floor. It sticks and is hard to remove. It also caused a problem with the gas burners on my stove."
1631,Bereicherung,"Das Ger_t funktioniert einwandfrei und man merkt den Unterschied, gerade nach l_ngeren L¨¹ften bei kaltem Wetter.
Kein optisches Highlight aber die Handhabung, dass ist mir wichtiger, ist tadellos.
Die Steuerung per App mit Reinigungsbenachrichtigung verdient 6*."
1632,Verdampft,"Macht was es soll, Wasser vernebeln. Ob die Prozentangaben am Ger_t so stimmen, wie dran steht, wage ich zu bezweifeln. Richte mich da immer nach einem anderen Hydrometer im Raum"
1633,Prima,Alles bestens
1634,incorrect values,"the humidifier is great but it's values are often up to 20% higher then my other 3 humidity-sensors

you can set the humitiy at a certain value +-5% e.g. 60% --> 55-65%. I would appreciate if I could change this value to whatever value I'd like e.g. +-10% --> 50-70%"
1635,VERY high output," I thought I¡¯d get one of these to see if I could improve the quality of my sleep by increasing humidity.

I don¡¯t really think I needed to but nonetheless this humidifier is a bit of a monster. Absolutely LOADS of moisture.

The app/smart control works really well and the automatic mode achieves target humidity no problem at all."
1636,"Bien, pero para que 6 litros de autonom¨ªa para recomendar cambiar el agua cada d¨ªa","Su funci¨®n la hace y muy bien, respiro mal por nariz, y llevo unos meses en un lugar con ambiente muy seco, con lo que, sobre todo de noche, se me secaba en extremo la garganta
Pero me chocan los seis litros de capacidad, con el hecho de que recomienden cambiar el agua a diario.
Por lo que respecta al ruido, no me molesta en absoluto, pero sufro de ac¨²fenos, con lo que, un poco de ruido hasta me va bien para enmascarar los pitos."
1637,Prodotto differente da quello acquistato,"Ho riscontrato che il prodotto acquistato, differiva dalla pagina di vendita. Nello specifico, il prodotto venduto nelle immagini ha la presenza di un filtro all'interno del serbatoio, al contrario il prodotto arrivato e era sprovvisto. Fatto reso"
1638,Ottimo acquisto,"Ottimo acquisto, silenzioso, senza luce."
1639,Schimmelmagnet,"Topfilling ist ja cool und bequem, aber dieses Produkt ist ¨¹berhaupt nicht zu empfehlen... warum? Weil es ein absolutes Schimmelmagnet ist !!! Es zieht Schimmel richtig an !!!

Ich putze den Luftbefeuchter alle 4 Tage weil er bei mir im 50qm offenen Raum eingestellt auf 55% Luftfeuchtigkeit alle 4 Tage neu Wasser braucht. Dabei putze ich den Wassertank auch immer so gut es geht und habe trotzdem jedes mal nach ~3-4 Tagen etwas Schimmel im Wassertank !!!

Ich habe andere Luftbefeuchter anderer Marken, da kommt auch nach 2+ Wochen ohne putzen kein bisschen Schimmel vor !!! Es liegt meiner Meinung nach also h_chstwahrscheinlich am Material."
1640,Useless,I bought this to replace my old noisy Sunbeam unit and I regretted since day 1. The unit would not turn on again in auto mode once it shut off. Also it it always notifies me to add more water although it is completely full and under the max line. After numerous troubleshooting attempts it is a complete dud. I've cleaned it and have only ever used distilled water as recommended too. Save your money and look elsewhere.
1641,Parfait,"Je suis tr¨¨s satisfaite de cette humidificateur , il fonctionne bien , il ne fait de bruit , pas de fuite , et la capacit¨¦ 6L est vraiment pratique , j'ai ¨¦t¨¦ surprise par les notifications sur le portable , ex:  lorsque que j'ai soulev¨¦e le bac pendant l'utilisation. ""J'en ai re_u une disant que ""le bac a ¨¦t¨¦ soulev¨¦ ""
Les r¨¦glage avec le smartphone sont faciles.
Contente de cette achat ."
1642,Qualit¨¤ prezzo eccezionale,"Prodotto molto valido, di facile utilizzo come precedenti modelli"
1643,Ottimo acquisto!,"Tutto funziona perfettamente. Non ¨¨ rumorose (anche se io lo uso solo di giorno) Facile aggiungere acqua. Compatibile con Alexa e funziona anche con app del cellulare. Forse ci vuole un po troppo per raggiungere umidit¨¤ desiderata (lo tengo in alto, forse devo provare metterlo in basso, perche foro del vapore va piu in alto). Comunque ha sempre piu meno stessi valori che stazione meteorologica. (Lo uso per lavoro nel quale livllo di umidit¨¤ ¨¨ importante) Si puo mette in due modalit¨¤: auto e quindi impostare valore da raggiungere, dopo quale si abbassa o spegne, per poi riacendere quando serve, oppure mamuale e impostare forza di vapore bassa, media o alta. Per me un ottimo acquisto."
1644,Super Produkt,Sehr zu empfehlen. Bedienung und smarte Einbindung waren super. Das Ger_t verteilt einen guten Nebel und ist auch gut f¨¹r das Schlafzimmer geeignet
1645,UNA MARAVILLA,"Controlas en todo momento desde el m¨®vil la Humedad, modo autom¨¢tico o manual,
En el modo manual LO _NICO es como se te olvide puesto, te funciona sin parar aunque llegue al 90% de humedad y te deja el cuarto super h¨²medo.
TE AVISA cuando limpiarlo y cuando esta vac¨ªo, el modo auton¨®mico mantiene la temperatura que tu desees en todo momento, apagando y encendi¨¦ndose.
Una calidad en los materiales incre¨ªbles y un dise_o much¨ªsimo.
Content¨ªsimo con el resultado."
1646,portable and top filling,"I like the humidifier,  it is top filling and has many adjustments for your needs of humidity in your space. makes a difference in comfort in my room"
1647,Gasket that connects to water started to melt.,"I have used the product with only water, filtered.

After about 2 months, the rubber gasket at the reservoir base started to peel and I noticed black particles floating at the base connection.

When I looked closer at the rubber, it looked like it was melting off and was peeled back tremendously."
1648,Its quiet and identifies the humidity in the room,Am using this product for a large room
1649,Serve allo scopo,Capiente e facile da usare. In condizioni medie il serbatoio consente 24 ore di umidit¨¤ al 70%
1650,Nur mit destilliertem Wasser zu gebrauchen :-(,"Ich habe den Luftbefeuchter nun seit ca. 4 Monaten im Einsatz.
Bef¨¹llt habe ich ihn bisher mit Leitungswasser, welches vorher durch einen Wasserfilter gefiltert wurde.
Obwohl wir hier kaum kalkhaltiges Wasser haben, hat sich nun ¨¹berall in der Wohnung ein feiner wei_er Film auf den Oberfl_chen gebildet.
Das Ger_t ist somit dauerhaft nur mit (teurem) destillierten Wasser zu verwenden. Pro Tag kann man schnell 3-5L verbrauchen.
Schade, dass man keinen entsprechenden Filter im Ausstr_mer verbaut hat. Ich w¨¹rde das Ger_t deshalb nicht weiterempfehlen."
1651,Very silent,Very happy with this product.
1652,Working good for the dry winter,"Working good for the dry winter we had. Best to use distilled water as recommended in the instructions but I just used filtered water.

Clean regularly because the filtered water did leave some residue after a few weeks of use everyday."
1653,Silencieux,"Tr¨¨s silencieux et tr¨¨s beau et tr¨¨s bon produit. On peut ¨¦teindre l'affichage, ce  qui permet de mieux dormir. Plus, compatible avec Google home et Alexa, ce qui permet non seulement de le contr_ler ¨¤ distance, mais aussi de savoir le taux d'humidit¨¦ dans la pi¨¨ce, allumer l'appareil, l'¨¦teindre, ajuster le taux d'humidit¨¦....
Je le recommande."
1654,Non male,No proprio nuovo ma cmq ottimo stato.un po' rumoroso. Spedizione velocissima
1655,,
1656,Works great but the on/off button is not easy to use,"As a humidifier works great.  Connects with my Alexa well enough and easily controlled that way. Top fill is nice, I use a pitcher to fill instead of messing around with the reservoir. My main complaint is the unit does not indicate you have turned it on.  Almost returned it thinking it was broken.  Just need some patience."
1657,Nice Humidifier worth for the money.,"Awesome Humidifier, doing its job. easy control from the Wifi App. Love the wireless control of the product."
1658,Fantastic,Great machine works super well. Very quiet you don¡¯t even hear it working.
1659,Show wrong humidity value 50%  on display. The right humidity is 32 %. So auto mode is useless.,
1660,Leaking after only 2 weeks use....,The water tank started leaking from the back after only 2 weeks use. There was no damage to the product that would cause this. The product is overall good but this issue demonstrate that the quality might not be the best...
1661,Aparato moderno y eficiente.,"Excelente. Tengo varios humidificadores. Este es moderno; f¨¢cil de recargar el agua, aun con el aparato en marcha. Manejo a trav¨¦s de la app y Wifi f¨¢cil, ¨²til y c¨®modo. Puede cubrir una superficie tal y como se indica, pero hay que pensar en una ubicaci¨®n adecuada. El higr¨®metro incorporado es relativamente fiable. Hay que repetir ajustes en Auto para encontrar punto ¨®ptimo de humedad relativa para que corresponda a la humedad en el recinto - disponiendo, claro est¨¢, de otros higr¨®metros para comparar. Muy silencioso. Hay que colocarlo a media altura para facilitar la recarga del agua (una jarra grande es muy adecuada) - el manejo de la tapa es f¨¢cil y no es necesario quitar el recipiente del cuerpo principal para rellenarlo bajo el grifo (salvo para la limpieza). Magn¨ªfica compra."
1662,Unreliable Operation,"Humidity sensor is unreliable with incorrect reading most of the time. Purified water should be used, otherwise there is always a layer of fine dust on the furniture or on floor. The app is working but with ads. Its is quiet in operation though."
1663,Humdifier doesn¡¯t reach or cross over 40 humidity level,"Humdifier doesn¡¯t reach or cross over 40 humidity level , even though it¡¯s been running for 2 days in a row . Not sure how long it¡¯s gonna take more ."
1664,Easy to use and is quiet.,Use this in our bedroom. Perfect with the sleep mode when its on and the display switch is off.
1665,"Facile da pulire, ma ha i suoi aspetti negativi","Aspetti positivi: Facile da pulire. I controlli sono facili da capire. Il ripieno dall'alto ¨¨ ottimo. Ottimo prezzo.

Aspetti negativi: Il misuratore di umidit¨¤ ¨¨ costantemente errato perch¨¦ la nebbia cade intorno all'unit¨¤ e causa una errata del misuratore. Il mio appartamento (circa 42 mq) ¨¨ molto molto asciutto e questa dimensione non cambia molto nel nostro ampio soggiorno e cucina open-space. _ utile nella camera da letto separata, ma ci serviva una macchina in grado di gestire grandi spazi aperti.

Non abbiamo deciso se tenerlo o restituirlo perch¨¨ a questo prezzo e qualit¨¤ ¨¨ una bella macchina e di facile manutenzione nonostante gli aspetti negativi."
1666,Trop dangereuse,"Faites attention avec cette machine, ultra dangereuseÿ tu te Connect ¨¤ la machine e tout va bien ÿ. Tu met une valeur de 50ÿ tout nickel ÿ le matin tu te r¨¦veille tu vois une valeur de 72ÿ trop dangeureux ÿ passez votre tour ÿ"
1667,Me gusta c¨®mo funciona,Para una habitaci¨®n humeda
1668,Buena difusi¨®n de sanitizante,"Pr¨¢ctico de usar, nada de ruido."
1669,Top Produkt,"Habe den Luftbefeuchter nun schon einige Wochen und muss sagen, dass ich in groben und Ganzen sehr zufrieden bin. Die % der Luftfeuchte stimmt mit meinen daneben hin gestellten Luftfeuchtemesser ¨¹berein. Ich finde auch, kann nat¨¹rlich auch Einbildung sein, dass wir seit dem Luffi einen besseren Schlaf praktizieren. Die Bedienung ist sehr einfach und nicht komplex, die Zusammenarbeit mit Alexa funktioniert tadellos, man Alexa sagen, dass sie z.B.: 60 % einschalten soll, dito auch die Programmierung der Zeit und Tage wann sich der Luffi einschalten soll. Von daher, volle Sterne"
1670,Gutes Ger_t k_nnte vom Design sch_ner sein erf¨¹llt aber den Zweck.,Schnelle Lieferung Ger_t funktioniert gut.
1671,Easy to use and refill,"A super quiet solution to moisturize the air in my bedroom, giving me a better sleep.
Easy to operate and clean. I haven't bothered to put the software on my phone.
I am surprised how much water I use overnight on auto. (not a full tank)"
1672,Weniger als erwartet,"Wir haben uns f¨¹r das Ger_t entschieden, aber das was es machen sollte hat es nicht zufriedenstellend ausgef¨¹hrt."
1673,LEVOIT Humidifier,Excellent humidifier. Very quiet and works very well. Very easy to operate. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a bedroom unit.
1674,Taux d'humidit¨¦ erron¨¦,Le taux d'humidit¨¦ est tr¨¨s souvent faux et donc l'humidificateur ne se d¨¦clenche pas.
1675,Pour une grande pi¨¨ce,"J¡¯aimerais en acheter un autre au m¨ºme prix, soit 120$ et sans frais de livraison"
1676,Works very very well.,Very impressive. Good price too. Sleep design for any decor and easy to move from room to room.
1677,J'adore!,Ne prends pas beaucoup de place et fonctionne tr¨¨s bien. Tr¨¨s silencieuse
1678,Ger_uscharm,Ich hab diesen Luftbefeuchter jetzt ca 2 Monate und ich kann nur sagen er ist sein Geld wert. Das Bef¨¹llen ist super einfach. Der Ger_uschpegel ist minimal und f¨¹r mich erf¨¹llt er vollkommen seinen Zweck.
1679,Au top,"Apr¨¨s avoir fait tout un tas de recherches je ne regrette pas mon achat.
Ayant un po¨ºle ¨¤ granul¨¦ l'air de notre pi¨¨ce ¨¤ vivre ¨¦tait tr¨¨s sec.
Avec un tr¨¨s bon rapport qualit¨¦ prix cet humidificateur fait le job malgr¨¦ un grande pi¨¨ce. L'humidit¨¦ est remont¨¦ un peu.
_videmment ce n'est pas ¨¦norme vu la taille de la pi¨¨ce il nous aurait fallu un appareil beaucoup plus mais il permet tout de m¨ºme de faire remonter un taux d'humidit¨¦ correct.
Comme dans beaucoup de commentaires il vaut mieux s'¨¦quiper d'un hygrom¨¨tre s¨¦par¨¦ car celui de l'appareil est fauss¨¦ par la brume qu'il produit autour de lui.
On en trouve facilement ¨¤ 10 euros sur amazon.
La connexion ¨¤ google home fonctionne tr¨¨s facilement et permet de l'allumer ou de l'¨¦teindre voir de baisser la puissance sans se d¨¦placer.
Penser ¨¤ enlever la mousse situ¨¦e sous le r¨¦servoir de l'appareil."
1680,Perfetto veramente ottimale e bello da vedere,"Fa il suo dovere benissimo ottimo prodotto, comodissimo il timer e la gestione dall app anche molto bello esteticamente consigliatissimo veramente ottimo!"
1681,Does the job.,This is the quietest humidifier I¡¯ve ever had. I like the fact that it holds 6 L of water so I don¡¯t have to fill it so often. It¡¯s been working very well for us.
1682,Kann ich empfehlen,"Komfortabel, sehr leise, leicht zu reinigen"
1683,2 mal bestellt 2 mal defekt,"Wir haben uns dieses Ger_t gekauft und waren sofort total begeistert
Bedienung einfach
Ger_uschlos alles super
Nach 2 Tagen fing es an total zu stunden
Egal was wir getan haben ob Leitungswasser oder destilliertes es stank enorm

Wir haben das Ger_t Zur¨¹ck gesendet und ein anderes bestellt wieder das selbe
Es kann ja mal eines dabei sein das einen Fehler hat

Das zweite jedoch konnten wir nicht einmal einschalten denn gleich nach dem bef¨¹llen hatten wir eine Riesen _berschwemmung im Zimmer das Ger_t ist total undicht und ich meine nicht Tropfen sonder richtig undicht
Alles was in den Tank war lief schwallartig nach dem drauf setzen auf die Station raus

2 mal bestellt 2 defekt
Schade es w_re ein richtig tolles Ger_t ansonsten"
1684,Wrong choice!!!,The Humidity levels shown are completely wrong. This makes the automatic on/off function obsolete.  Not to recommend.
1685,Schimmel bildung,"Trotz sterilen Wasser und regelm__igen Reinigungsarbeiten hat sich ein Geruch entwickelt an dem ich den Ger_t auseinanehmen m¨¹sste um zu sehen dass es an drei kleine stellen sich schimmel gebeldet hat, es ist ja feucht aber nirgend wo steht dass die stellen sicnd besonders gef_hrdet .. bilder kommen irgendwann es hat mir schon bereits zu viel Zeit genommen"
1686,Simple ¨¤ utiliser,Tr¨¨s bon achat. Correspond ¨¤ ce que je recherchais.
1687,"very quiet and easy to operate, it has several settings a to change flow from low to high","Our humidity was low due to very cold conditions outside together with low moisture  and humidity has improved since we have used the Levoit humidifier, it is very quiet and could be used in any area of your home."
1688,levoit humidifier,works amazing
1689,broke after 2 weeks,"it worked fine for 2 weeks and last night, the display of percentage does not show anymore, the mist becomes intermittent. beware this item is not refundable. for this price range, i expect better quality"
1690,Very useful,"We're enjoying our new humidifier. It's not very big, but enough to cover our living and dining area. Just one warning: we have a gas stove next to the dining area and we noticed that the colour of the flame on our burners changed from blue to completely yellow. We got answers online and were told to use distilled water in our humidifier, not regular water, it must be distilled. Regular water impacts the flame on your gas stove. You can look it up online. We made the change and the flame was back to blue. Now mind you, it's not as if you can't cook with the yellow flame, though it's not recommended, it's just not as hot and takes longer. Aside from that, the product is as good as advertised."
1691,Good machine but doesn't add humidity - but busy directly from Levoit!,"I either got a defective batch or the machines don't add enough humidity. I put 2 machines in one room under 500 sq ft to try and I couldn't get the humidity to rise not even by 1%. It actually dropped. I think I personally got a defective batch. Everything else about this machine is amazing - SUPER quiet, easy to clean, and no lights at all which is great for babies and those sensitive to light. The one thing you need to know if Amazon as a seller is TERRIBLE! They do NOT accept returns even if defective! There is no mention of this at all whatsoever on their listing, and yet they think it is legal to keep your money for defective items. I would buy directly from Levoit - They are AMAZING with customer service."
1692,Great conected humidifier,Very quite and good air flow control.  Minor issue with timing out with app and assistant but woukd recommend.
1693,Bon rapport qualit¨¦ prix et produit au top, Super humidificateur. Bon rapport qualit¨¦ prix. Niveau bruit il est tr¨¨s discret m¨ºme en mode high. Fonction minuteur et ¨¤ distance au top.
1694,Perfect!,"I like that the light can be turned completely off, also the display, and I like the app that comes with it, i like the topfill option, the touch on the unit is not the best, but the app does the job!"
1695,hum,works great
1696,Super,Ein sehr gutes Produkt. Es eignet sich super f¨¹r etwas gr__ere R_ume. Man merkt nach kurzer Zeit den Unterschied im Zimmer. Steuerung per App klasse
1697,super quiet and effective,"Finally a really well designed humidifier. We have a very large room and other portable humidifiers cannot make a dent in the humidity level. This one does a great job and is silent. We cannot hear it at all. It is super easy to refill, with no spilled water, and washing is a breeze as it is so easy to dissassemble, and the tank cover is removable."
1698,very quiet & top fill,take too much  time to clean
1699,Ottimo prodotto," Per il momento mi trovo ampiamente soddisfatto, ha un bel getto di vapore , io lo uso in maniera manuale"
1700,Umidificatore al top,"Prodotto molto funzionale e costruito bene. Ha la possibilit¨¤ di essere controllato con una app che consente di accendere/spegnere o controllare a distanza l'umidit¨¤, nonch¨¨ impostare altre regolazioni (es. timer, programmi, ecc.). Il getto ¨¨ sufficiente per una stanza di medie dimensioni. C'¨¨ un cassettino apposito per inserire oli essenziali per aromaterapia. Manuale ben fatto ed esaustivo. Top"
1701,So far so good!,I love that this product connects to smart device. So far it seems like a good investment.
1702,I have to keep setting the Schedule I¡¯ve set,"Love this humidifier, it¡¯s quiet & works great in my bedroom. This only negative comment I have is the App I use for this humidifier. It only works for a few days, after that the App says Wi-Fi is not working when it fact there is Wi-Fi. I have to reinstall the app every time in order for the schedule I set to work.  Also sometimes when I use the app to turn off the humidifier it doesn¡¯t turn off."
1703,Works well,Keeps the humidity level up in my small condo.  No more shocks!
1704,Efficient but inaccurate,"The hydrometer is around 10-15%, which makes the display a little useless, but seeing as auto mode is adjustable in the app, not the end of the world.

On the other hand, my apartment went from 10% RH (according to my other hydrometer) to 25% in a day on medium a feat that my other humidifier couldn¡¯t achieve in a week on high. The tank is easy to fill, and seeing as I¡¯ve been using filtered water, I haven¡¯t seen any white dust as of yet.

Bonus- my cats love watching the mist come out of it.

Overall a decent product with some flaws but also built in workarounds."
1705,El mejor vaporizador,"Es la mejor opci¨®n para personas con rinitis o alergias. Humedece el ambiente, lo puedes programar, prender y apagar a distancia y la carga de agua dura much¨ªsimo. Es sumamente silencioso, ni siquiera se nota que  produce alg¨²n ruido.

Un poco caro, pero vale cada peso."
1706,fantastic product,"Works great, so quiet!"
1707,Serves the purpose,"I¡¯m not an expert on humidifiers but with my first experience, this model checks all boxes. No noise and keeps my bed room in acceptable humidity level. Easy to clean"
1708,Ok,Leider etwas laut
1709,Great humidifier,Easy to set up. App is easy to use. Prduct works perfect.
1710,"Ger_t top, App nutzlos","Mit dem Ger_t bin ich sehr zufrieden, nur Kleinigkeiten st_ren. Der Automatikmodus ist nicht die beste Idee des Herstellers gewesen.
Da das Ger_t ja direkt vor Ort seine Luftfeuchtigkeit misst, ist der Wert nat¨¹rlich deutlich h_her, als im Rest vom Raum.
Ich habe in 4m Entfernung ein Hygrometer stehen. Da meine Wohnung nicht 100% dicht ist und es manchmal etwas zieht, erkennt man direkt ob sich die Luftfeuchtigkeit verteilt oder steht.
Den Befeuchter habe ich im Wohnzimmer (33qm) stehen und lasse Ihn 24/7 auf _Low¡° laufen, so bewegt sich meine Luftfeuchtigkeit immer zwischen 46-60%, was optimal ist.
Die App ist allerdings nutzlos, einmal funktioniert die Verbindung nach Installation, seitdem nie wieder.
Da ich auf den Automodus verzichten kann, st_rt es mich aber nicht weiter.
Der Wassertank reicht etwa 36-40h auf _Low¡°.
Ger_usche sind kaum wahrnehmbar und nur bei absoluter Stille h_rbar.
Kann das Ger_t somit empfehlen."
1711,Easy to use,Great machine.  Works very well with the cell phone.  Would be better if the auto feature had a mist level choice as well.
1712,nur f¨¹r ein kleines Zimmer geignet,
1713,absolut ger_uschlos und gut leistungsf_hig,Befeuchtet gut die ganze untere Etage
1714,FUNZIONALE E SILENZIOSO MA QUASI INDISPENSABILE COLLEGARLO AD APP,Molto silenzioso anche in modalit¨¤ non notturna. Sta funzionando correttamente in modo continuo. Ho dovuto collegarlo alla sua app per poter disporre di tutte le sue possibilit¨¤ elencate nelle caratteristiche. Il suo segnalatore di umidit¨¤ fa quello che pu¨° ma in ogni caso l'umidit¨¤ dell'ambiente effettivamente aumenta ed in modo non fastidioso. Non ho mai rilevato gocce o goccioline di acqua nemmeno nella sua immediata vicinanza. Se posto in zona di passaggio e non vicinissimo a muri funziona correttamente senza farsi sentire.
1715,Top,Super
1716,N/A,N/A
1717,"No funciona para aromaterapia, no me funcion¨®.",Este humidificador no funciona para aromaterapia. No lo recomiendo si es lo que buscan.
1718,Ottimo prodotto,Ottimo semplice ed efficace
1719,Ho restituito,"Sembrava un buon prodotto, per¨° al nostro caso ¨¨ stato difettoso, ho effettuato il resto. Grazie al servizio che sono stati onesti e hanno rimborsato il prodotto difettoso."
1720,Excellent,Tr¨¨s silencieux
1721,Silencieux,Bon produit tr¨¨s efficace et silencieux
1722,Impressive,"I¡¯m really happy with this dehumidifier. I had been having persistent sore throat and dry nose problems because of my too-well-sealed double glazing and central heating in a new build flat, but they cleared up virtually overnight after I started using this in my living room in the evenings. It¡¯s really easy to use and it pumps out an impressive jet of atomised water. The display is clear and the touch sensitive buttons work well. It¡¯s quiet enough to have turned on in the background while I¡¯m reading but I¡¯d probably not have it on in the bedroom when trying to sleep. The build quality seems really good and it is easy to keep clean. Overall I¡¯m pleased I went for this one."
1723,Buen humidificador,"Funciona muy bien. Sin ruido. Se tendrian que poder fijar los  parametros de % humedad y niebla sin necesidad de bajar aplicacion en el movil y hacerlo directamente en el aparato.
Me llena el alrededor de un polvillo blanco imagino que es cal del agua del grifo. Muy facil de limpiar."
1724,Comoda,Molto utile e silenzioso
1725,Sehr Zufrieden!,"Das ger_t ist wirklich sehr leise, st_rt nicht beim schlafen, die Bedienung ist einfach, speziell mit der Handy App, der tank ist gross und es schaft einen raum mit 60m2 einfach - die Automatik funktioniert reibungslos.

Sehr empfehlenswert!"
1726,Need to download the app to get the most benefit  from the machine,So far so good worth the money. Happy with purchase
1727,Leider nur beschr_nkt ohne App verwendbar,"Das Ger_t produziert sofort einen Nebel nach dem Einschalten und ist dabei wirklich leise. Je nachdem wie leicht man schl_ft, kann man das Ger_t sicher auch im Schlafzimmer aufstellen, aber besser nicht zu nah beim Bett, da es doch nicht komplett lautlos ist.

Schade finde ich, dass man es nur beschr_nkt ohne App benutzen kann. Es hat zwar eine Luftfeuchtigkeitsanzeige vorne aber der Hygrostat kann nur per App eingestellt werden, sprich ohne jene l_uft es immer auf einem der drei Stufen (low, medium, high oder auto, wobei ich nicht weiss welche Feuchtigkeit er da anpeilt, 50%?).

Die App kann man wiederum nur mit Account benutzen, was f¨¹r mich ein No-Go ist. Unter Aufsicht kann man das Ger_t aber sicher problemlos ohne App benutzen."
1728,Disappointing!,No remote as per your illustration.  It is fiddly working the machine without the remote.
1729,Umidificatore,"Arrivato nei tempi previsti, ben imballato.
Facile da utilizzare , una pecca secondo me ¨¨ il programma automatico.
Una volta programmato arriva al 50% di umidit¨¤ e non riparte quando l'umidita si abbassa.
In manuale funziona benissimo."
1730,Super Leise,"Ein tolles Ger_t, das sehr Leise ist wenn es arbeitet. Habe sehr stabile Werte im Raum, seit ich dieses Ger_t Benutze. Sehr gutes Preis-Leistungs-Verh_ltniss."
1731,Perfekt,H_lt was es verspricht!
1732,Poorly designed humidifier,"The smart mode doesn't work. The humidity level displayed is off (much higher) so it will shut off the unit before it reaches the ideal humidity level. Also, I have been using the unit for 2 hrs in my small studio at at high setting and my humidity level went from 17% to 21%... still super dry air.

I do not recommend for dry Canadian winters. Not worth 100$."
1733,Best humidifier ever!,"I am 63. Raised two sons and still in a 45 year relationship with a husband who has chronic upper airway issues.  I have bought countless humidifiers. This Levoit model is the best.  It has a very large reservoir.  It is easy to fill. It works great.  I leave it on high all night in my husbands bedroom ( he has. neurological disease that makes him very restless while sleeping) and it keeps his room just right.  Not sure what all the complaints are about......if you want a humidifer that does the job well and consistenly this it.  Going to order twomore, one for living room with the 30 plants in there and one for my room also.  would be great for a babies room or child. Levoit should put a permanent sticker on the reservoir under its name reminding in large letters the units MUST be cleaned once a week as per instructions.  LIke all humdifiers!"
1734,Probably one of the best machines on the market!,I like them so much that I bought two! I can control the humidifier via my phone or alexa ... I normally suffer from nosebleeds because of dryness but now I don't... absolutely love it!
1735,"Gut, k_nnte aber besser sein (Einstellungen)","Zu dem Ger_t kann man nichts negavitves sagen. Auch im. 50 m2 Wohnzimmer keine Probleme.
Auch mit alexa und der app alles ohne Probleme.

Das einzige ist die Einstellung in der App.
Genau zu sein : man kann einen gew¨¹nschten Wert einstellen, dieser wird dann um 5 Prozent erh_ht und stoppt dann automatisch. Eigentlich perfekt. Nur ist 5 dann zu viel. Es ware besser wenn man es individuell einstellen kann. Bedeute 5 hoch aber nur 2 runter z. B.

Ansonsten echt nicht zu bem_ngeln.
Kann ich empfehlen"
1736,excellent,"cela fait 2 semaine que je l'ai achet¨¦ , je suis tr¨¨s satisfaite, il est silencieux,  facile ¨¤ utiliser et ¨¤ nettoyer, combien de temps me durera t-il ? On verra !"
1737,Super unit,Had some trouble at first (my fault). GREAT customer service.  Highly recommended.
1738,Hygrometer zeigt falsche Werte,"An sich an qualitativ solides Produkt, das im manuellen Modus zuverl_ssig seinen Dienst verrichtet. Daf¨¹r g_be es die volle Punktezahl.

Leider zeigt der eingebaut Hygrometer w_hrend des Betriebs Werte an, die v_llig daneben liegen. Verglichen mit meinen zwei anderen Hygrometern, die in etwa denselben Wert anzeigen, liegt der Levoit Hygrometer ca. 20% dar¨¹ber!! Das f¨¹hrt somit s_mtliche Smartfuntionen des Ger_tes ad absurdum, denn stelle ich z.b. ein, dass das Ger_t auf ein Luftfeuchtigkeit von 50% hinarbeiten soll, stoppt es bereits bei ca. 30-35%."
1739,"Sehr leise, befeuchtet gut","Habe den Befeuchter im Flur stehen, tut was es soll, ist dabei sch_n leise"
1740,gegen trockene Heizungsluft,"der Luftbefeuchter ist leise, wie versprochen und in der Bedienung recht simpel. Ob man die App braucht wei_ ich nicht."
1741,Indispensabile,Top
1742,Very quiet,"There¡¯s a float switch inside the base. We only use distilled water in ours, and it does a great job. Integrated humidistat, and desired level of humidity is expressed as a percentage. Does a fine job and is very quiet, almost noiseless"
1743,Wow!,Excellent!  Very well made and sturdy.  Easy to set up and control over wifi and voice commands.  Would recommend.
1744,Does the job,The machine is very quite and works well and the app works great.  You can turn the lights and display off in the evening when you want to sleep
1745,Perfetto.,"Acquistato per evitare di avere in casa un effetto di aria secca con la stufa accesa, fa ottimamente il suo lavoro.
Non do la 5 stella, per il fatto che con Alexa si pu¨° solo accendere e spegnere, mentre per le impostazioni bisogna parlare inglese.
L unica pecca riscontrata, dar¨° la 5 stella qua do l italiano sar¨¤ implementato e lo si potr¨¤ sfruttare al 100% in domotica."
1746,Manual required,"I am pleased with the product but would find it easier to use, clean, etc. if I had a manual.  Is there a filter?  I am visually impaired and would appreciate a manual I could read on my closed circuit TV.  thank you for your attention to this matter."
1747,Inget,Funkar kanon
1748,Terrific Humidifier.,Setup so simple. Has raised hydration from 30% to 50% overnight. Simple to refill water tank from top of unit. Smart phone set up is easy to follow. I do recommend this product to everyone.
1749,2nd unit and loving it!,This is our 2nd unit and we love it! One for our daughters room and one for ours. Works well with google
1750,Sending back.,"Worked well for about a week, then started to leak. Leaking never stopped so it's going back."
1751,Einfach tut,"Einschalten, gew¨¹nschte Feuchtigkeit % einstellen und nachf¨¹llen wann kommt Nachricht am Handy."
1752,No hace nada de ruido,"Es muy silencio,"
1753,ottimo umidificatore,"Ottimo umidificatore con delle caratteristiche che a mio giudizio lo fanno preferire a molti altri prodotti:
- molto silenzioso
- carica dall'alto molto facile e pratica
- facile gestione con app anche da remoto
- Alexa compatibile
- lunga durata dell'azione senza necessit¨¤ di dover riempire nuovamente il serbatoio

Unica pecca (motivo per cui lo valuto 4 stelle e non 5): c'¨¨ solo di colore bianco, il che in alcuni ambienti st¨¤ bene, mentre in altri stona: un vero peccato, perch¨¦ di colore nero (molti altri competitor offrono lo stesso dispositivo sia bianco che nero) a mio giudizio si potrebbe utilizzare in ambienti (ad es. nelle zone living) dove anche l'aspetto e il design conta, senza che l'apparecchio assomigli troppo ad un dispositivo medicale"
1754,Disappointed,"Reason for buying this unit: I wanted a humidifier to keep a 40 to 45 % humidity range in winter. I liked the idea that this one would pause at 50% on auto. I also wanted a transparent tank to check water level at a glance.
Pros: looks nice, very quiet, clear tank and very easy to fill.
Cons: turns out that this model cannot do what it is intended to do. It has a serious design flaw. The hygrometer is directly on the machine which results in a false reading of overall room humidity level. Mine indicated between 55 and 65% when 10 feet away another very reliable hygrometer was at 40 %.  Since the auto mode pauses at 50 %, it will never start.
Aroma drawer is useless. Maybe if I empty the whole bottle of essential oil ÿ.
I don't use the app or any lighting feature.
Bottom line, I would have been better off buying a simple $50 unit since the features justifying the higher price don't work.
I could send it back but it's too much of a hassle."
1755,Wonderful Humidifier,"I didn't realize how dry my place was, I had a high efficiency furnace installed and wow, it really dried out my  place, especially now since it is winter.  My plants were wilting so quickly after being watered.  They are grateful for the humidifier too!  Highly recommend!  Super quiet!, super everything!"
1756,Buon prodotto,"Buon prodotto, silenzioso ed efficace. Compatto e semplice da utilizzare"
1757,L_uft Feucht :),"Also kurz und knapp:
+Top fill
+Alexa steuerbar
+Einfache Einrichtung
+6l Tank der auf voller Stufe mit W_rme ca 12std reicht.
-sollwert f¨¹r die Feuchtigkeit l_sst sich nur ¨¹ber app einstellen und nicht am Ger_t selber.
- in Schlafzimmer kann er st_rend sein wenn man empfindlich ist, ist aber bei allen kalt verneblern so.
Fazit:  Preis Leistung top.  Gro_er Tank und smart home f_hig. _ber App eingerichtet und erf¨¹llt seinen Zweck."
1758,Au top,Ce produit est top
1759,Auto Mode works if you keep a fan on it.,"Keep a fan on it if you have it in auto mode because the humidistat overestimates the humidity in the room and shuts off too quickly without airflow. Otherwise its a great device, and works well!"
1760,Es funktioniert lautlos,"Es funktioniert lautlos. Da der Wassertank gro_ ist, kann er die ganze Nacht arbeiten. Wir k_nnen mehrere, automatische Schlie_- und _ffnungszeiten einstellen. Mit der Anwendung, die wir auf unserem Telefon installieren, k_nnen wir sie sowohl ein- als auch ausschalten und alle Einstellungen vornehmen."
1761,Top Ger_t,"Ich bin ja mit positiven Bewertungen eher etwas zur¨¹ckhaltend. Bei diesem Ger_t  geht das aber nicht. Das Teil ist, f¨¹r mich jedenfalls, sehr leise und kann auch mal etwas l_nger in der Nacht laufen. Der Tank ist gut ausreichend und die Timerfunktion ist auch sehr praktisch. Das Ger_t l_sst sich auch sehr gut ¨¹ber die App steuern. Die unterschiedlichen Modi funktionieren auch gut. Also alles in allem ein sehr gut. _ber die Langlebigkeit oder die Steuerung mit Alexa kann ich (noch) nichts sagen."
1762,Zeigt falsche Werte an!,"Kann das Ger_t leider nicht empfehlen.
Es zeigt im Wohnzimmer ¨¹ber 70% an, obwohl zwei andere Ger_te 45 anzeigen.
Im Bad hat es 60% angezeigt, obwohl dort die anderen Messger_te ¨¹ber 90% angezeigt haben.
Die Ger_te standen dort mehrere Stunden, die Werte stimmten aber trotzdem nie."
1763,ein tolles Ger_t,"Bin froh das ich es gekauft habe, Einfache Bedienung funktioniert mit dem App wunderbar."
1764,Zu lauf,F¨¹r die Nacht viel zu laut. Pl_tschert die ganze Zeit.
1765,SILENCIOSO Y CAPACIDAD,"Lo compr¨¦ para sustituir otro que habia que sacar el deposito para llenarlo.
Volver a colocar un deposito lleno de 6 litros era una fiesta. A este le levantas la tapa y rellenas con una jarra sin moverlo.
Es silencioso, tiene programitas, no vibra.
Lo mejor, lo tengo hace meses funcionando 24 horas sin parar al tope de potencia, y exactamente cero problemas."
1766,Pues muy buena compra,"Hace poqu¨ªsimo ruido y funciona bastante bien. Ademas con la app lo puedes manejar de lujo, programar para que se apague por la noche o conectarlo a Alexa y a google. Aunque yo soy de iPhone y no he visto la posibilidad de que se pueda usar con Siri....mmmmm.. ains!"
1767,Simple efficace,"Appareil simple d'utilisation, tr¨¨s efficace et surtout silencieux ! J'en suis tr¨¨s satisfaite !"
1768,"Producto de calidad, pero decepcionado!","El producto en s¨ª es bueno; Calidad, silencioso, accesible para limpieza, peeero... Para m¨ª uso en concreto me ha decepcionado porque lo utilizo exclusivamente para dormir y soy de esas personas que desconectan la wifi por la noche y ah¨ª reside el problema que el humidificador tansolo se conecta con wifi y no con los datos del tel¨¦fono y la mayor¨ªa de configuraciones s¨®lo se pueden hacer a trav¨¦s de la aplicaci¨®n con el tel¨¦fono.
Lo que ¨¦s lo mismo, dependes de la aplicaci¨®n en el tel¨¦fono para configurarlo y de que est¨¦ conectada la wifi (los que no dispongan de wifi, mejor olviden ¨¦ste modelo) de lo contrario no podr¨¢n disfrutar de todas sus opciones!!!
De haberlo sabido no lo habr¨ªa comprado, pero repito, el aparato en si es bueno!!"
1769,The moist air is much better!!,"The moisture in the air makes breathing much better. This very quite , easy to clean and fill"
1770,Ottimo,"Silenzioso lo uso in camera per dormire, consiglio acqua distillata, ottimo"
1771,"Bene, ma non perfetto","Questo modello di umidificatore ¨¨ di buona fattura ed esteticamente mi piace per la sua semplicit¨¤. Il display si pu¨° spegnere tramite un tasto apposito e la rumorosit¨¤ e bassa, quindi passa completamente inosservato. Volendo si pu¨° accendere con due livelli di luminosit¨¤ la luce del serbatoio con un unico colore.
Il serbatoio ha una capienza enorme, 6 litri.
Passiamo alle cose che non mi sono piaciute: il funzionamento in AUTOMATICO ¨¨ impreciso perch¨¨ l'umidit¨¤ rilevata ¨¨ pi¨´ alta di quella reale, quindi non ¨¨ utilizzabile e bisogna scegliere manualmente il livello di vapore; il cassetto in cui vengono messi gli oli essenziali non serve a nulla perch¨¨ non si sente nessun profumo poi.
Rapporto qualit¨¤/prezzo nella norma, nulla di eccezionale."
1772,Probl¨¨me de d¨¦tecteur d'humidit¨¦,"Il y a un probl¨¨me avec le d¨¦tecteur d'humidit¨¦, il affiche 10% de plus que le mod¨¨le pr¨¦c¨¦dent et que mes hygrom¨¨tre.
le r¨¦glage manuel est moins bien que le mod¨¨le pr¨¦c¨¦dent. En pus on perd la fonctionnalit¨¦ air chaud."
1773,H_ller vad den lovar,Efter tre veckors anv_ndning har jag inte hittat n_got att klaga p_. Den g_r jobbet utan att st_ra det minsta.
1774,Excellent humidifier,Excellent machine very quiet and lots of vapour
1775,Fehler: Wasser angeblich leer!,"Ich habe dieses Ger_t im Automatikbetrieb in meiner Wohnung laufen und bekomme t_glich unz_hlige Benachrichtigungen, dass sich das Ger_t abschaltet, weil angeblich kein Wasser drin sei.

Abends sehe ich, dass der Tank sehrwohl gef¨¹llt ist. Dieser Fehler ist mir schleierhaft.

Die Ger_uschentwicklung ist auch absolut nicht f¨¹r einen Schlafraum zu empfehlen.

Absolut keine Kaufempfehlung!"
1776,Sehr entt_uschend,"Wir haben das Ger_t eine Woche gehabt. Erstmal zu den positiven Aspekten: Der Ger_uschpegel ist wirklich sehr angenehmen. Der Luftbefeuchter konnte nachts laufen, ohne das wir ihn wahrgenommen haben. F¨¹r kleine R_ume ist er _mehr¡° geeignet als f¨¹r gr__ere. Unser Schlafzimmer hat um die 25qm und daf¨¹r hat er gute Arbeit geleistet.

Nun das negative:
Er stand bei uns auf dem Boden, der Wasserdampf hat sich nicht weit nach oben verbreitet sondern hat sich relativ schnell auf dem Boden abgesetzt. Deshalb hatten wir ihn auf einem Hocker, was definitiv besser war. Aber das das Teil ausl_uft, w_hrend er nicht in Betreib war (bei uns Tags¨¹ber) und das Wasser sich still und heimlich auf unserem neuen Laminatboden verteilte, hat uns sowas von ge_rgert. Daher nach einer Woche Testen zur¨¹ck."
1777,The best humidifier ever.,"This is my second Levoit humidifier, I gave my older unit to my daughter. The 300S works perfectly."
1778,Impossible to return/get a refund,"I bought it for my sick mother, but didn¡¯t need it at the end. However, the unit was impossible to return. Beware."
1779,"Gutes Ger_t, Wirkung l_sst zu w¨¹nschen ¨¹brig","Ich bin mit dem Ger_t sehr zufrieden. Das eingebaute Hygrometer ist leider sehr ungenau. Es zeigt bis zu 10 % unterschied an. Ist aber soweit kein Problem wenn man den manuellen Modus benutzt.
Jetzt kommen meine Probleme:
Man muss destilliertes Wasser kaufen, was gar  nicht wenig kostet. Mit 5 ltr bin ich jetzt mal 1,5 Tage ausgekommen :-( kostet 3 euro!
Und nun das gr__te Problem:
Einmal l_nger gel¨¹ftet und die Luft ist wieder trocken wie vorher! :-( Die Wirkung ist auch nicht nachhaltig also hei_t es: alles wieder von vorn! :-(
Daf¨¹r kann aber das Ger_t nix bzw. bekomm ich dann die Luftfeuchtigkeit bald mal wieder zusammen.
Ich behalt mir das Teil jetzt aber der Kostentaufwand ist schon sehr enorm."
1780,Cumple con su misi¨®n perfectamente,"Funciona d maravilla y te avisa por la app d todo, si se queda sin agua, si esta mal puesto, si esta sucio.... Es incre¨ªble"
1781,Top befeuchter nur zu empfehlen.,"Sehr leise und einfach via App Steuerbar.
Hab den Befeuchter bei uns im Schlafzimmer stehen und dieser l_uft von 20 bis 6 Uhr. Durch die Einstellung der gew¨¹nschten Feuchtigkeit l_uft das Ger_t auch nicht permanent durch, geht aber auch wenn man will. Was auch super ist es lassen sich alle lichter und das Display komplett ausschalten und der Befeuchter l_uft weiter. Zudem ist das mit Abstand der leiseste Befeuchter den ich h kenn, klare Kauf Empfehlung"
1782,Cumple su funci¨®n,"Est¨¢ muy bien, no hace ruido, tiene buena potencia y es bonito. Lo ¨²nico que no me ha gustado es que cada poco pide limpieza, te salta el mensaje cada poco tiempo. Por lo dem¨¢s perfecto."
1783,Funktioniert bei mir nicht,"In meinen Zimmern ist die Lift immer sehr trocken, ca 20%-30% deshalb habe ich mich entschieden einen Diffuser zu kaufen, dieser l_uft nun seit 2 Tagen auf h_chster Stufe jedoch _ndert sich an der Luftfeuchtigkeit nichts, der Diffuser zeigt zwar *Immer* einen Wert von ca 64% an aber meine Wetterstation die nicht unmittelbar beim Nebel steht sagt da was anderes. Heute nacht habe ich versucht den Diffuser direkt neben das Bett zu stellen damit meine Nase nicht immer derma_en ausgetrocknet ist, hat leider ebenfalls nicht geholfen. Das war meine Erfahrug."
1784,Sensore umidit¨¤ funziona male,"Forse ¨¨ un problema solo del prodotto che ho ricevuto ma il sensore di umidit¨¤ non funziona come deve. Quando accendo l'umidificatore segna quasi sempre oltre 50 anzi fino a 75. Avendo altri sensori di umidit¨¤  (split Daikin e MultiSensor Zwave) nello stesso ambiente che segnano 30-35 capisco che ¨¨ completamente sballato. Quindi mettendo l'umidificatore in modalit¨¤ 'Auto' ovviamente non funziona. Se lo metto in manuale (anche solo 'Low'), l'umidificatore emette il vapore e il sensore piano piano scende dai 70+ fino attorno ai 45. Morale il mio umidificatore deve sempre essere avviato in manuale. Ho ovviamente provato a cambiare orientamento dell'apparecchio facendo attenzione che nulla fosse davanti al sensore ma senza risultati."
1785,Consigliato,Soddisfatta dell'acquisto silenzioso e durevole ed economico
1786,Top Ger_t,"Dienstag bestellt und Mittwoch schon geliefert.

Ich hatte bereits ein Ger_t eines anderen Herstellers im Einsatz.  Aber dort war die Reinigungsm_glichkeit derart schlecht dass ich den Befeuchter auf den Schrott geworfen habe.  Ersatz musste her.

Ok... die Rezensionen sind sehr widerspr¨¹chlich aber ich habe es trotzdem gewagt.

Resultat nach einem Tag Einsatz.  Arbeitet sehr zufriedenstellend und auch das Ger_usch gibt keinen Anlass zur Beanstandung.

Werde das Ger_t weiter beobachten und ggf.  die Rezension anpassen bzw. korrigieren.

Auf jeden Fall nach jetzigem Stand eine uneingeschr_nkte Kaufempfehlung."
1787,Spettacolo,Funziona benissimo
1788,Firma nach einem halben Jahr nicht mehr exsistent,Ger_t defekt nach 7 Monaten und kein Support mehr
1789,Wei_er Nebel ¨¹berall,Anfangs war das Ger_t super! Mit der Zeit hat sich dann rausgestellt dass sich ¨¹berall wei_er Nebel auf s_mtlichen Kunststoffteilen und Hochglanzfronten gebildet hat. Aus diesem Grund wurde dieses Ger_t auch wieder zur¨¹ckgesendet.
1790,Best customer service!!!,"Thanks for accepting my product return! This is defintely a good product, I will buy again once my situation changes."
1791,Super,Funktioniert einwandfrei
1792,vermutlich passen die m_ Angaben nicht ganz,"Eigentlich l_uft er recht gut. Jedoch haben wir das Gef¨¹hl, dass die Angaben der Raumgr__e ihn an seine Leistungsgrenze bringen. Wenn wir ihn nicht ¨¹ber die Zeitschaltuhr bremsen w¨¹rden, l_uft er st_ndig und bringt jetzt im Dezember durchschnittlich 45 % Luftfeuchte ins Wohnzimmer.  Aber technisch ist alles bestens. Der Verbrauch von destilliertem Wasser ist verdammt hoch!"
1793,Totally silent.,"I grow orchids in my lounge. This humidifier keeps the air quality exactly
right, and is completely silent."
1794,Ger_uschpegel,Sehr leise sowie Preis/Leistung ist stimmig.
1795,difettoso,"sembrava tutto ok. prodotto ben fatto e di facile utilizzo, funzionava bene. ma dopo 2 giorni ha iniziato ad incepparsi in continuazione la valvola di riempimento e si bloccava in continuazione. scritto al supporto che per¨° non mi ha risposto subito e ho deciso di renderlo e sostituirlo con lo stesso prodotto (sperando che questo funzioni). nel frattempo sono stato contattato dal supporto, ma alla mia risposta che avevo chiesto la sostituzione, mi ¨¨ arrivato questo messaggio a dir poco molto dubbio...

Gentile cliente,
grazie per averci contatto.
Hai contattato Amazon e hai scambiato il tuo prodotto per ottenere un nuovo umidificatore?
Tutti i ns. prodotti hanno una garanzia di due anni, non esiste di contattarci se incontra qualsiasi problema.
Buona giornata

ho chiesto spiegazioni sulla frase "" non esiste di contattarci se incontra qualsiasi problema"", ma sto ancora attendendo risposta.
se effettivamente intendevano dire ci¨° che hanno scritto, sperate solo di non aver bisogno di assistenza.
appena mi arriva il nuovo prodotto e mi rispondono dar¨° aggiornamenti.

AGGIORNAMENTO
sono stato ricontattato dal servizio clienti dici mi hanno spiegato che avevano commesso un errore di battitura e non intendevano scrivere "" non esiste di contattarci se incontra qualsiasi problema"" , ma volevano dire "" non ESITI di contattarci se incontra qualsiasi problema"".
poi il nuovo prodotto per ora funziona bene."
1796,"Ottimo prodotto, regolabile anche da remoto, unica pecca il rilevamento dell'umidit¨¤","L'umidificatore ¨¨ ben costruito e facile da utilizzare. Di seguito un piccolo elenco dei punti positivi e i punti negativi di questo prodotto:

+ Facilit¨¤ d'uso
+ Controllo da remoto e integrazione con Alexa
+ Capienza
+ Luce notturna e modalit¨¤ selezionabili

- Il sensore per l'umidit¨¤ ¨¨ poco preciso e a volte salta dal 50% al 30%, inoltre non segna mai l'umidit¨¤ corretta (mi sono basato su un vero termometro che ho in casa)
- L'aroma inserito nell'apposita vaschetta si sente veramente poco"
1797,Es l_uft wie es soll.,Esszimmer + Wohnzimmer.
1798,You don't have to babysit it,"The tank is large (12 hours+) and fills easily (=from the top).  I am a super light sleeper, but this one does not keep me awake.  Haven't had enough time to set it up so I can operate it from my phone.  All in all, though, it is by far the best humidifier I have bought.  I have bought a second one."
1799,"Does the job, Top filling added bonus",Our house was very dry. Managed to bring up the humidity level in a medium size bedroom to a very comfortable 75% level.
1800,The app makes using the humidifier so easy.,"Easy to use and manage by way of the app. The app makes this product, which is also easy to clean and maintain. The water reservoir is a good size, thus ensuring against constant refills. Very pleased with how it functions and its very reasonable price tag."
1801,Bin absolut begeistert,"Der erste Luftbefeuchter kam bei uns an und hatte leichte Probleme, der Sensor f¨¹r die Erkennung vom Wasserstand war augenscheinlich defekt. Dank dem tollen Service der Hotline von Amazon, bekam ich ein Ersatzger_t noch an Heiligabend, daf¨¹r geb¨¹hrt Amazon mein aufrichtiger Dank und Respekt. Das Teil ist genau das, was wir uns f¨¹r unser Schlafzimmer vorgestellt hatten. Es ist leise, erzeugt ausreichend Dampf, alles in allem sind wir komplett von unserem Luftbefeuchter ¨¹berzeugt, alle Daumen hoch.
Noch einmal Dankesch_n an Amazon f¨¹r diesen tollen Service."
1802,Passt Super,"Habe eins wegen trockener Luft im Schlafzimmer angeschaft. Habe nach Test drei im Haus.
Sonst naoch was?"
1803,Silent and effective,"Been great for winter so far, helps to balance the room when the heating is on full tilt.  The plants love it, and the missus reports she doesn¡¯t feel as stuffy in the mornings.

Great purchase, but expensive luxury that one probably doesn¡¯t NEED in daily life."
1804,Ottimo prodotto,"Consegne sempre top
Il prodotto fa benissimo il suo lavoro
Facile da controllare da remoto cambiando la potenza del getto a propio piacimento o programmare in automatico la percentuale di umidit¨¤ desiderata e lui va sa solo e stacca quando raggiunge l¡¯obiettivo
CONSIGLIATISSO"
1805,Great product,Unit is well designed and works seamlessly. Remote app is particularly useful and works seamlessly via Bluetooth
1806,Non bellissimo ma ben funzionante,"Acquistato per umidificare una stanza di circa 20mq, fa pi¨´ che bene il suo lavoro.
Sebbene esteticamente non sia un'opera d'arte, funziona molto bene, ¨¨ molto silenzioso e facile da mantenere.
Comodissima l'app che ti permette di calendarizzare l'utilizzo e ti avverte quando il contenitore ¨¨ vuoto o va pulito"
1807,Excellent humidifier,"Works very well, as advertised. Interface is easy to use. Very quiet and easy to clean. Highly recommend."
1808,il ne respect aucune valeur en automatique et en manuel s¡¯arr¨ºte tous seul sans jamais  red¨¦marrer,"cet appareil est un vrais gadget qui ne respecte aucune des valeurs demand¨¦es en automatique et s¡¯arr¨ºte tous seul sans jamais red¨¦marrer quelque soit le mode de fonctionnement. a ¨¦vit¨¦ absolument si vous souhaitez g¨¦r¨¦ l¡¯hygrom¨¦trie de votre logement correctement.
si vous voulez de mani¨¨re tr¨¨s al¨¦atoire g¨¦n¨¦rer un petit peu de fum¨¦e faite vous plaisirs."
1809,El mejor que he tenido hasta ahora," Ahora que llevo con el casi dos meses ya puedo daros mi opini¨®n. He tenido varios de varias marcas y este es el mejor que he tenido hasta la fecha. La niebla es impresionante en su nivel m¨¢s alto y tiene un dise_o bonito. La capacidad del tanque es suficiente para una noche al m¨¢ximo de niebla y sobra como un cuarto de dep¨®sito o m¨¢s. Son 6 litros, se puede usar agua del grifo sin filtrar sin problemas, no hace falta que sea mineral, filtrada o descalcificada. Donde vivo el agua es muy dura y no he tenido ning¨²n problema. Es f¨¢cil de montar y desmontar para su limpieza. Me encanta que te avise de cuando toca limpiar el tanque y el interior. La app es muy intuitiva y se puede controlar por Google Assistant o Alexa.
Las pegas que le puedo poner son:
- Ni Alexa ni Google entienden en espa_ol la orden de apagar la luz del tanque, solo lo he conseguido con Google en ingl¨¦s. ""Turn the light of the humidifier off""
- No tiene Integraci¨®n con IFTTT. Aunque la app Vesync aparece para integrarla, no aparecen los humidificadores. Por lo que no puedo hacer automatizaciones con Smart Life y otras marcas de dom¨®tica.
Cuidado con tener muebles no hidrofugos de madera cerca, la niebla puede llegar a mojarnos un poco. En mi caso son resistentes a la humedad."
1810,Ok ma sopravvalutato...,"Nel complesso accettabile ma le specifiche sono molto esagerate in quanto a potenza umidificante. In una notte intera al massimo della potenza, in una stanza di pochi mq e con soffitto basso l'umidit¨¤ ¨¨ passata dal 46% al 53% misurata con uno strumento esterno.
Il sensore di umidit¨¤ incorporato, invece, da misurazioni completamente sballate quindi l'automatismo ¨¨ inutilizzabile."
1811,Fruchtbar Ger_t,"Eigentlich das Ger_t war nicht so praktisch f¨¹r die kleine Fl_che, ich habe Feuchtigkeit um das Fenster und auf die Wand , und das Fenster immer nass jeden Morgen und ich lasse das Ger_t ganze Nacht funktioniert, aber bleibt nass mit mehr Feuchtigkeit.
Deswegen meine Bewerbung ist 1 Sterne .
Danke"
1812,Buena calidad pero...,"Me gusta que se pueda programar todo, hora, potencia, luz, todo..
La verdad el medidor de humedad no me inspira mucha confianza,,, y eso hace que a pesar de sentir que la habitaci¨®n est¨¢ reseca, por tener la garganta seca,, no funcione en toda la noche porque dice que la habitaci¨®n est¨¢ al 60% de humedad,
Gasta mucha agua al m¨ªnimo, yo uso agua mineral para que no se rompa y duele ver que en una noche puede gastar,,, lo que le eches, al m¨ªnimo se puede beber 2 litros en 10 o 12 horas, por lo dem¨¢s funciona bien, poco ruido al m¨ªnimo y buen nivel de vapor"
1813,I love this LEVOIT Humidifier,Highly recommended
1814,Don't buy this lemon,It's a piece of garbage
1815,Il prodotto funziona bene e a un ottimo getto aria umidificata,"Il prodotto funziona bene e facile da configurare e semplicissimo da caricareÿ Cosa importante per un contenitore da 6 l
Peccato che lo scotch che hanno utilizzato si ¨¨ appiccicato alla plastica e pur frizionando con l¡¯alcol gli aloni sono rimastiÿ Non capisco se usato uno scotch scadente e non removibile oppure se ¨¨ stato conservato il prodotto in un ambiente dove la colla dello scotch Si ¨¨ attaccata permanentemente !
In allegato le fotoÿ _ un peccato perch¨¦ questi aloni sono veramente tanti estetici"
1816,Perfetto,"Ottimo prodotto, estremamente silenzioso, facilissimo da usare, l'app ¨¨ fatta molto bene ed ¨¨ molto intuitiva. 10 e lode!"
1817,Ein super Ger_t,"Ein sehr gutes Ger_t!
Macht was es soll!
Mit Alexa steuerbar und funktioniert super!
Leicht zum reinigen!"
1818,Top!," Au top!

24h d'utilisation et pas de fuite comme sur les commentaires pr¨¦c¨¦dents.
Il faut bien penser ¨¤ retirer la mousse bleu du flotteur ^^

Aucun bruit, possible de le connecter ¨¤ l'application ou de faire sans elle et ce sans soucis. Avec l'application possible de le connecter ¨¤ Alexa et c'est top

Devo dire che su 100 notti, si e no, avr¨° russato un 4 o 5. Premetto che prima utilizzassi ogni notte i cerottini nasali, eppure non facevano nulla. Inoltre ho letto che l'ambiente abbastanza umido allontana malesseri come raffreddore, come se decongestionasse.

1827,"Raumluftbefeuchtung funktioniert super, Reinigung echt _tzend","Das Ger_t befeuchtet zuverl_ssig die Raumluft (nutze es f¨¹r zwei jeweils 20qm gro_e R_ume mit gro_er Durchgangst¨¹r), es tut also absolut das, was es soll. Aber die Reinigung, die alle 10 Tage vorgenommen werden soll (und selbst bei Verwendung von ausschlie_lich destilliertem Wasser auch notwendig ist), ist ziemlich nervig / kompliziert. Viele Ecken sind ¨¹berhaupt nicht erreichbar, habe Sp¨¹lb¨¹rste, Schwamm, kleine Flaschenb¨¹rste f¨¹r Glastrinkhalme etc. ausprobiert."
1828,Luftbefeuchtung gut. Smart Funktionen funktionieren nicht in lokalem Netzwerk.,"Zuerst das Positive:
Befeuchtung und Bedienung funktionieren wunderbar. Die angezeigte Luftfeuchtigkeit ist genau (plusminus 2 bis 3 Prozentpunkte Unterschied zu meinen Messger_ten). Eine ausreichende Bedienung ist auch ohne App Verbindung noch m_glich. Allerdings l_sst sich dann unter anderem die Zielfeuchtigkeit nicht einstellen.

Nun das Negative (woran sich vermutlich aber (leider) eher weniger Leute st_ren w¨¹rden):
Leider ben_tigt das Ger_t f¨¹r die Bedienung ¨¹ber WLAN zwingend eine Internetverbindung. (Nein, das ist nicht dasselbe.) Des Weiteren muss ein Account in der Vesync-App erstellt werden. Eine Steuerung rein ¨¹ber Alexa ist sonst nicht m_glich. Alexa und der Luftbefeuchter befinden sich im selben Netzwerk. Dennoch funktioniert die Steuerung nicht, wenn der Internetzugriff f¨¹r den Luftbefeuchter gesperrt ist (und er somit nur auf das lokale Netz zugreifen kann.) Warum nicht? Wof¨¹r wird die Internetverbindung zwingend ben_tigt? Meine Lampen kann ich ¨¹ber Alexa dimmen und meine Steckdosen ein- und ausschalten, ohne, dass diese daf¨¹r Zugriff auf das Internet ben_tigen.
Ich finde es ausreichend, wenn einzig ein als Hub fungierendes Smart Home Ger_t auf das Internet zugreifen kann, welches alle anderen verbundenen Ger_te dann ¨¹ber das lokale Netzwerk steuert. Aber so bin ich darauf angewiesen, dass auch noch der Hersteller des Luftbefeuchters bekannt werdende Sicherheitsl¨¹cken zeitnah schlie_t.
Was dem Hersteller zugute gehalten werden kann, ist, dass Vesync anscheinend ein Bug Bounty Programm zum Aufdecken von Sicherheitsl¨¹cken anbietet. Allerdings h_tte ich dennoch gerne die Wahl, das Ger_t auch nur ¨¹ber ein lokales Netzwerk steuern zu k_nnen."

1832,"Solange er funktioniert, super Luftbefeuchter + Vergleich mit Levoit Dual 100","Vor 9 Monaten haben wir uns den Levoit Ultraschall Luftbefeuchter gekauft.

Das Ger_t ist gro_artig verarbeitet und optisch sehr ansprechend. Der Aufbau und die Inbetriebnahme sind einfach. Den vollen Funktionsumfang gibt es andererseits nur mit Einsatz der VeSync-App. Dort l_sst sich z. B. die Automatik mit Schwellenwert konfigurieren. Ist alles erledigt, l_uft das Ger_t dezent im Hintergrund. An und Abschalten des Nebels funktionieren tadellos. Die angezeigte Luftfeuchtigkeit im Ger_tedisplay _war¡° stimmig und somit gab es bis hierhin keinen Anlass zur Kritik.

Ab und zu wurden in der App f¨¹r den Luftbefeuchter Firmwareaktualisierungen angezeigt. Die Installation klappte meistens nicht im ersten Versuch, irgendwann war die Firmware aber installiert. Ob es mit der letzten Aktualisierung zusammenh_ngt, kann ich nicht sagen. Auf alle F_lle stimmen seit einiger Zeit die angezeigten Werte im Display nicht mehr und somit ist die Automatik unbrauchbar. Was komisch ist, die Luftfeuchtigkeit verstellt sich immer um ca. 13:00 Uhr und bleibt bis in die Nacht falsch. Zwei andere Hygrometer im Raum zeigen in dieser Zeit konstante, ¨¹ber 20 % niedrige Werte, an.

Das Ger_t wurde regelm__ig gereinigt und nach dem Auftreten des Fehlers auch zur¨¹ckgesetzt. Mit dem Support stand ich im Kontakt, bedauerlicherweise half alles nichts. Somit geht der Luftbefeuchter zur¨¹ck.

Kleiner Tipp:
Mit Einsatz von destillierten Wasser bleibt das Ger_t erfreulich sauber und an den Gegenst_nden im Raum gibt es keine wei_en Kalkablagerungen.

Update 17.01.22 mit Vergleich Levoit Dual 100 _ Classic 300S:

Da der Classic 300S zur¨¹ckging, ist hier seit einigen Wochen der Levoit Dual 100 eingezogen.

Optisch integriert sich der Dual 100 unauff_lliger ins Wohnzimmer. Unansehnlich fand ich den Classic andererseits auch nicht.
In Betrieb ist der Luftbefeuchter schnell genommen und die F¨¹llmenge geht mit 1,8 l in Ordnung. H_ufiges Nachf¨¹llen wird einem damit erspart. Die Bedienung ist mit den 2 Kn_pfen simpel.
Entweder nutzt man den Schlafmodus oder die 3 Nebelstufen (niedrig, mittel oder hoch).
Da man _therische _le direkt in das Unterteil tropft, wird der Duft, verglichen mit dem Aromafach vom Classic, entschieden besser verteilt.

Das Wohnzimmer ist 24 m_ gro_ und vom angegebenen Wirkungsbereich (10_24 m_) dasjenige Maximum. Folgerichtig zeigt sich hier der erste Unterschied, denn mit dieser Raumgr__e hat der Dual ordentlich zu tun. F¨¹r 5 % Erh_hung muss das Ger_t auf h_chster Stufe einige Stunden laufen. Beim Classic stieg die Luftfeuchtigkeit relativ flott. Ger_uschm__ig gibt es im Betrieb nichts auszusetzen.

Schade, dass es beim Dual 100 keinen Timer gibt. Dieser w_re in meinen Augen n¨¹tzlich gewesen.
Im Schlafmodus regelt der Levoit automatisch auf eine relative Luftfeuchtigkeit von 60 %. Im Wohnzimmer schaffte er es bisher nicht, denn vorher war der Tank leer.

Wie sieht nun mein Fazit aus? F¨¹r R_ume ¨¹ber 20 m_ w¨¹rde ich eher den Classic 300S empfehlen. Des Weiteren sind bei diesem die Funktionen (¨¹ber die App) erheblich umfangreicher. F¨¹r kleinere R_ume ist der Dual 100 eine gute Wahl. Da der Luftbefeuchter hier nur bei niedriger Luftfeuchtigkeit gestartet wird, bleibt er auf Erste stehen. Einzelwertung f¨¹r den Dual 100 _ 4 Sterne."
1833,Hygrometer,Produkt entspricht meinen Erwartungen. Leider ist der Hygrometer nicht genau sondern erkennt viel zuschnell ein Wert von dem Nebel somit denk man wenn man 50% das die Luft 50% hat. Was aber leider nicht derart ist daher keine volle Sterne.
1834,Classic 300S Automodus unbrauchbar,"Leider l_sst sich im Automatikmodus die rechte Feuchtigkeit nicht verstellen vorgegeben sind 45 % plus -5__ Leider liegt dann meine Raum Feuchtigkeit bei 35 % maximal der Grund das Ger_t zu kaufen war eigentlich die Automatik Modus mein Vorg_nger Ger_t hat 5 l in zwei Tagen verballert um 40 % zu halten das Ger_t Verbrauch 1 l die Woche also absoluter Schrott. Wer das Ger_t manuell betreibt oder mit Timer den mag es wohl zufrieden stellen,mich nicht."
1835,Can't rely on smart features,"Great on initial impressions... I was able to get it out the box and set it up in no time.

However after around a week, the unit lost wifi connection (its not positioned out of range at all). And any attempt to reconnect fails... No idea why. So now its not a smart device at all, I have to control it manually from the buttons on the unit."
1836,Does what it¡¯s supposed to do,Using it in the bedroom and has worked wonders against dryness.
1837,Reso,"Il prodotto ¨¨ fatto molto bene ed ¨¨ straordinario, sicuramente sono capitato male con un oggetto difettoso.
Il difetto che ha presentato era questo: provato tre giorni e problemi zero, praticamente una sera mi sono trovato tutta l'acqua per terra perch¨¨ il WIFI ha fatto partire prepotentemente l'apparecchio senza motivo e con la ventola al max  per il tempo di un pieno d'acqua, stavamo al piano di sotto e non ce ne siamo accorti, poi con l'impostazione automatica, volendo, si potrebbe anche uscire di casa.  L'applicazione mi aveva avvisato di controllare il contenitore, ma non ho dato peso perch¨¨ l'acqua era stata riempita da poco, a parte questo potevo non stare in casa.  Non mi sono fidato di tenerlo. Servizio ottimo di Amazon e sicuramente del venditore."
1838,Umidificatore ok e silenzioso,"Prodotto ottimo, dopo due mesi di utilizzo niente da dire di negativo. Livello di umidificazione nella norma per ora di funzionamento, funzionamento e pulizia semplice"

Wasserverbrauch gering, mehrere Programme, die alle tun, was sie tun sollen. Nicht einmal der Boden daneben, wo ich ihn stehen habe, wird richtig nass. Bin sehr zufrieden. Empfehlenswert!"

Unica cosa che mi lascia un po' dubbiosa ¨¨ la rilevazione dell'umidit¨¤, che si sballa subito appena si accende l'apparecchio, rilevando l'umidit¨¤ che produce ma non quella reale della stanza (almeno secondo me), quindi tenderebbe a restare poco acceso in modalit¨¤ auto. Usandolo manualmente invece io lo trovo ottimo."
1849,Soddisfatto,"Ottimo umidificatore, silenzioso e facile da usare, forse non bellissimo esteticamente ma efficace. Anche le mie piante sono contente."
1850,"Wie andere auch schon berichten, Luftfeuchtigkeitssensor defekt","Habe mir den Luftbefeuchter bestellt, da mein Schlafzimmer aufgrund der durch die Heizungen im Winter extrem trocken ist.

Ich habe eigentlich genau diesen aufgrund des Sensors bestellt.
In einem EXTREM trockenen Raum soll laut Sensor eine Luftfeuchtigkeit von 75-82% herrschen.
-> Auto Funktion somit nicht m_glich und f¨¹r mich keineswegs zu gebrauchen

W¨¹rde ich einen manuellen Luftbefeuchter haben wollen, w_re ich bei den g¨¹nstigen 20_ Dingern geblieben.

Finger weg."
1851,Falsche Messung der Luftfeuchte,"Ger_t funktioniert im manuellen Betrieb gut und leise. Jedoch war ein wesentlicher Kaufgrund die automatische Luftbefeuchtung mit integrierter Messung und genau diese Messung der aktuellen Luftfeuchtigkeit funktionier nicht.
Egal wo oder wie lange das Ger_t steht, es hat immer 10-30% Punkte mehr gemessene Luftfeuchtigkeit als andere verschiedene Messger_te! Es ist schon sehr schlecht von dem Ger_t, dass diese einfach Funktion nicht erbracht werden kann!
Daher f¨¹r Auto-Betrieb -> KEINE Kaufempfehlung."
1852,Good product,Good product.
1853,An exceptional humidifier with a few disclaimers,"There should be a lot of disclaimers to ultrasonic humidifiers in general, and also reviews who don't provide enough detail. For reference, I'm based in London so that's my use case for the humidifier.
 - Tap water can absolutely not be used for the humidifier, only distilled or purified water so that it does not lead to ""white dust"" (calcium landing everywhere from vaporising the water). The only cheap and viable solution to this problem that I've seen so far is using a ""zerowater filter jug"" to filter your tap water and then it's fine for use in the humidifier. Since the water needs to be changed regularly, it's best to only put in a bit of water (if your room is small, mine is quite small), which makes the zerowater jug quite cost effective as I'm only using it for the humidifier and not for drinking or cooking.
- The inbuilt hydrometer is not very good on it's own which makes the auto mode quite unusable unless you provide the humidifier with airflow, for me, I have a fan that I run on a low speed around it so the hydrometer is very accurate with this additional airflow (I have another hydrometer which I compare it to and it's usually only 2% higher than the true relative humidity). I think that if you did not provide it with airflow then the auto mode would not function well at all, out of the box it said my room was at 70% humidity while my hydrometer said it was at 35%.
- For my use case, I love having access to the humidifier via the app, I can even access it from anywhere as long as I have internet, it doesn't have to be the same network that the humidifier is connected to, I can turn it on before I get home to make sure the air is not dry while not having to leave it on all the time.
- Having alexa pairing is useful when I want to turn the humidifier off when leaving my room without needing to open the app

TLDR: To get the most out of this humidifier, it requires a little bit of airflow to make the hydrometer accurate and also zerowater filtered water to avoid white dust or white fog in your room. Despite it's price, it's one of the only humidifiers with this many features that make it a real convenience to use."
1854,"Keine Empfehlung, FINGER WEG!!!","Trocknet die Luft auf, bin mit Halsschmerzen und vertrockneter Nase aufgewacht, trotz Auto Modus!!! Und riecht auch metallisch, KEINE EMPFEHLUNG, ging sofort zur¨¹ck!"
1855,Bringt nichts bei uns im haus,"Ich habe aufgrund der guten Reisezonen dieses Ger_t gekauft, weil bei uns im Haus wegen der L¨¹ftungsanlage ziemlich trockene Luft herrscht.

Selbst wenn ich es 2 Tage im 15m2 Kinderzimmer laufen lasse ver_ndert sich die Luftfeuchtigkeit am Thermostat nicht grossartig."
1856,Perfekter Luftbefeuchter,"Wir sind sehr zufrieden mit dem Luftbefeuchter. Es ist kein Billigschrott, sondern gut verarbeitet und sehr robust. Man sollte/muss ihn regelm__ig reinigen, damit er lange funktioniert. Haben ihn im Wohnzimmer stehen, und ¨¹berlegen, noch einen f¨¹rs Schlafzimmer zuzulegen."
1857,Supper,
1858,Auto mode doesn't work,"The auto mode doesn't work. It turns off once the device goes above a certain humidity level, but then it doesn't matter how low does the humidity go, the device never turns on again. Also buttons are pretty unresponsive. Not the greatest quality thing..."
1859,Hygrometer funktioniert nicht,"Was soll ich sagen - Bild reicht aus um zu zeigen, dass das eingebaute Hygrometer nicht mal ansatzweise korrekt misst. Der Raum hat definitiv nicht die vom levoit angezeigt tropische Luftfeuchtigkeit. Auto-Funktion kann also garnicht genutzt werden. Manuell gesteuert tut das Ger_t was es sollÿ

Nachtrag: Nach ein paar Stunden manuellem Betrieb des Luftbefeuchters hat sich das Hygrometer eingependelt und zeigt jetzt halbwegs plausible Werte. Trotzdem w¨¹rde ich das Ding nicht auf auto laufen lassenÿ"

Unica pecca, se si vuole essere pignoli, ¨¨ la lucina notturna un po¡¯ ¡°scarsa¡±, ma almeno per quel che mi riguarda, ¨¨ del tutto irrilevante."
1866,Luftbefeuchter erf¨¹llt seinen Zweck,"Habe ca. einen 40m2 Raum wo ich den Luftbefeuchter verwende. Luftbefeuchter erh_ht die Luftfeuchtigkeit um ca. 9%.

1874,"The instructions are not clear enough for such a complicated, frustrating unit.","When I can get it to go, it is wonderful.  But it is the most impossible unit to operate.  It functions when it wants to function.  I find the instructions not very useful.  I have had two different people over to try to figure out the complications.

By Sunday the option to turn the night mode on (which allows the unit to run but turns the front lighting off) has stopped function and now when I push that button it turns the machine off.

Muy poco ruidoso, por lo que es apto para habitaciones si se quiere usar mientras se duerme.
Adem¨¢s el llenado superior es f¨¢cil, sin tener que sacar la cubeta, unido a su gran capacidad y su programaci¨®n permite llenarlo pocas veces c¨®modamente.
Al final era todo lo que buscaba en un humidificador, hasta he comprado un segundo igual."
1886,in dubbio sul reale funzionamento,"pacco arrivato nei tempi previsti. facile da configurare con l'app, facile da pulire per¨° ci sono dei ma. prima di tutto di notte ¨¨ rumoroso non da fastidio per¨° cmq fa rumore. seconda cosa io ho comprato questo prodotto perch¨¨ ho una casa con bassa umidit¨¤ per¨° non umidifica bene e quindi mi ritrovo un prodotto che non serve realmente a tenere l'umidificazione al meglio. per questo l'ho restituito."

1888,"Great product, shame about the algae buildup.","First of all, this is a great little humidifier. The app is great and the built in hygrometer is fairly accurate if you place the unit on a hard flat surface, Any pile of carpet will really hinder this machine.

My only big issue is that even with following the protocols around using treated water and changing it daily there has slowly become a buildup of algae due to the water tank being clear. This could easily be addressed with a design change."
1889,Zeigt falsche Werte an,"Ich kann den Luftbefeuchter nicht empfehlen.
Habe den ersten gekauft, zeigt nur zwischen 48% und 51% Luftfeuchte an. Automatikmodus also nicht nutzbar.
Vorhin hab ich das Ersatzger_t bekommen. Zeigt konstant 60% Luftfeuchte an.
Ich hab eine Wetterstation zuhause und es hat im Raum unter 30% Luftfeuchtigkeit (weshab ich das Teil bestellt hab).

Ich hab ehrlich das Gef¨¹hl man kann auf Amazon keine anst_ndigen Sachen mehr kaufen die zumindest eine mittere Qualit_t haben. Nahezu alles was ich kaufe ist entweder nach 4 Wochen kaputt oder funktioniert vom ersten Tag an nicht.

Daher w¨¹rde ich sagen: Bitte nicht kaufen. Lohnt sich nicht."
1890,Deine Pflanzen werden DANKE rufen.,"Ich habe den Luftbefeuchter gekauft, damit sich meine ¨¹ber die Coronazeit angesammelten Raumpflanzen ein wenig wohler f¨¹hlen.
Der Luftbefeuchter kam, praktisch verpackt nach kurzer Lieferzeit und wurde nat¨¹rlich direkt aufgebaut und ausprobiert.
Der Aufbau und die Inbetriebnahme sind ein Kinderspiel. Sobald die App installiert ist, kann der Spa_ losgehen. Die Einstellm_glichkeiten f¨¹r die Luftfeuchtigkeit lassen hierbei nichts zu w¨¹nschen ¨¹brig. Meine Pflanzen sehen mittlerweile (nach vier Wochen) schon deutlich vitaler und ges¨¹nder aus.
Jeder, der dar¨¹ber nachdenkt, sich den Luftbefeuchter f¨¹r seine Pflanzen zu kaufen sollte dies tun."
1891,Buen producto.,"Es muy pr¨¢ctico, f¨¢cil de usar."
1892,Es befeuchtet die Luft...,"Was soll ein Luftbefeuchter? Luft befeuchten...  und genau das tut das Ger_t. Ohne Schnick und ohne Schnack - ganz ohne App.  Ja, das geht...
Das Ger_t ist erstaunlich leise (im Vergleich zu meinem Vorg_ngermodell) und der Nebel sinkt wie gewohnt zu Boden - muss er ja auch wegen der h_heren Dichte zu Luft. Wer also trockenen Boden will, der muss das Ger_t eben h_her stellen... (1,50m Sinkh_he bei mir reichen aus... Arbeitsplatte + Ger_t + Aussto_)
Was Keime und Kalk betrifft: Man muss halt entkalken und notfalls auch mal die chemische Keule gegen Keime schwingen. Das ist halt so bei solchen Ger_ten leider so. Oder man muss destilliertes Wasser verwenden gegen den Kalk.....
Ich bin zufrieden, denn die Luft wird befeuchtet - was ja auch der Grund war, das Ger_t zu kaufen. Und reinigen muss man eh... wartungsfrei ist leider immer noch Utopie.
Nachtrag nach einigen Monaten: Die Kalkablagerungen sind schon massiv und man muss den Wasserbeh_lter sehr gr¨¹ndlich entkalken, besonders den Luftschacht - aber auch die Basisstation.. und ja, auch das Ventil ist recht empfindlich und man muss sehr vorsichtig die _ffnung und das Ventil selber reinigen und durch Drehbewegungen wieder quasi ""einschleifen"", damit es dicht wird.. eindeutig eine Schwachstelle (der Schwimmer darunter hat zu wenig Auftrieb, daher ist die Feder, die das Ventil schlie_t, recht schwach). Wenn man das akzeptieren kann, dann bleibt es ein prima Ger_t. Ich komme damit gut klar und es l_uft wie D_ppken"
1893,Bis Lang..,"Bis lang Hammer, hatte vorher einen anderen den ich wergen Defekt zur¨¹ck gesendet habe. Anderer Anbieter ! Der Befeuchter arbeite sehr genau . Ich hoffe es bleibt so"
1894,Contento con el aparato f¨¢cil de conectar con Alexa,El aparato es de tama_o medio-grande pero muy silencioso f¨¢cil de usar lo eleg¨ª por poderse conectar a Alexa y lo recomiendo 100%
1895,Geruchsneutral ohne Zusatzstoffe,Die Maschine ausgepackt programiert und seitdem l_uft das Ding
1896,Waaaay Better,Much improved over last LeVoit Humidifier we had! So far after a month's use loving using it!
1897,Tut was es soll und das unkompliziert.,"Das Ger_t ist selbsterkl_rend, hat nicht viele verwirrende Einstellungen und tut was es soll - die Raumluft regulieren. Einstecken, Bef¨¹llen, einschalten, fertig. Auch die Bedienung ¨¹ber die App samt Alexa Funktion ist super. Man kann auch prozentual die gew¨¹nschte Luftfeuchtigkeit einstellen und das Ger_t h_lt diese dann in der Luft, sprich regelt sein Ein- und Abschalten automatisch. Das finde ich auch klasse.

Ich erh_he damit die Luftfeuchtigkeit meines Raumes, um den Pflanzen was Gutes zu tun und es funktioniert. Sie sind irgendwie gr¨¹ner und wachsen schneller und ich kann auf das manuelle Bespr¨¹hen der Bl_tter nun getrost verzichten. Gutes Teil - guter Preis. Ich w¨¹rde es wieder kaufen"
1898,Erf¨¹llt seinen Zweck,"Der Luftbefeuchter arbeitet einwandfrei und lie_e sich ¨¹ber die angegebene App leicht bedienen....wenn die App funktioniert, denn ich muss nach jeder Nutzung nein Handy neu starten, weil ich keinen Zugang zur App mehr bekomme und mein Ger_t nicht einstellen kann. Hier sollten schnell bessere Alternativen angeboten werden. Bei der Nutzung des Ger_tes in kleinen R_umen, ist zu beachten, dass die Einstellung der Nebelst_rke nicht zu hoch sein darf, weil sich die feuchte Luft dann als N_sse absetzt und es zu Schimmelbildung kommen kann. Daf¨¹r ist das Ger_t super leise, man kann prima einschlafen und es ist vollkommen geruchsneutral. Mit einer funktionst¨¹chtigen App w_re es ein empfehlenswertes Produkt."
1899,Es muy util,"Me gusto, es facil y como de usar con la App, no hace ruida y cumple con el cometido. Muchas gracias"
1900,Fantastico,"umidificatore eccellente, ottimo da usare la notte per umidificare l'area,compatibile perfettamente con alexa"
1901,Validissimo a dir poco,"Che dire, non proprio il prodotto piu economico della categoria, ma decisamente vale ogni centesimo.
Design elegante e pulito. Facilissimo da pulire e da ricaricare senza bagnare in giro come capita con prodotti simili.
I pulsanti touch sono comodissimi e intuitivi. Poche funzioni, ma che permettono di fare tutto ci¨° che serve e anche di pi¨´.
Poter poi controllarlo a distanza con la comodissima app ¨¨ la chicca in pi¨´ che a suo tempo mi ha convinto di acquistarlo e che oggi, dopo qualche settimana, non posso che apprezzare per la semplicit¨¤ e la precisione con la quale si possono impostare le varie automazioni, timer, livelli desiderati e quant'altro.

Altra nota positiva, per sincronizzare app e wifi ci sono voluti davvero meno di due minuti"
1902,"Makes a lot noise, how can I sleep ¡á_","Makes a lot noise, how can I sleep ¡á_"
1903,Genialer Luftbefeuchter!!,Installation via App sehr einfach. Vernebelung auch sehr gut. Man kann auf einem Kissen _therische _le verwenden. W¨¹rde ihn wieder kaufen!!
1904,Die Erwartungen waren to much,"Die Materialen vom Geh_use und Zubeh_r sind sehr gut.
Die App ist sehr ¨¹bersichtlich und einfach zu installieren.
Der Wasserdampf ist stark fast zu viel, kann man aber minimieren.
Negative: Das Geh_use ist sehr gro_ und nimmt viel Platz weg.
Der Luftbefeuchter sollte weiter weg stehen und nicht nah am Bett oder Couch, sonst hat man den Nebel im Gesicht und vor den Augen."
1905,Humidifica,Hay que ver a largo plazo porque el modelo anterior en menos de un a_o empez¨® a perder el agua del dep¨®sito y a caer por la mesilla y el suelo de la habitaci¨®n y me ped¨ªan que para la garant¨ªa mandara un v¨ªdeo. En finÿ que me compre este a ver q tal
1906,Top Ger_t sehr zu empfehlen,Ich bin echt begeistert. Zu einem durch die Steuerung durch Alexa und Oder Handy App. Zum anderen ¨¹ber den gro_en Tank. Sowie ¨¹ber die einzelnen Funktion
1907,Not so smartÿ..,Worked fine for 10 days but then the app was updated and no longer stays connected via Wi-Fi making it not so smart!ÿÿlooks like I will be returning for a refund.
1908,Great humidifier,"It's perfect for my plants (but also for me!). Big tank, so less refill, automatic mode and easy to control with Alexa. I' m really satisfied!"
1909,Tuve que devolverlo empezo a fugar el agua del tanque,"Me gust¨® el producto pero tuve que regresarlo, me duro 2 semanas, empezo a fugar agua del tanque"
1910,consigliato,"silenzioso, facile da usare e ottimo umidificatore"
1911,Entt_uschend f¨¹r den Pflanzen-Bereich,"Ich habe das Ger_t f¨¹r meine Pflanzen gekauft, haupts_chlich habe ich mich f¨¹r dieses Ger_t wegen der M_glichkeit der Handyverbindung entschieden und muss daher sagen: Ich bin sehr entt_uscht, nicht bei meinem urspr¨¹nglichen Hersteller geblieben zu sein.
Besonders aus folgendem Grund kann ich das Ger_t nicht f¨¹r die Pflanzen-Community empfehlen: Andere Ger_te sind einstellbar mit Zeitpl_nen. Dies schafft dieses Ger_t auch, allerdings nur mit der Zeit. Viele Pflanzen lieben es beispielsweise, wenn abends die Luftfeuchtigkeit h_her ist als z.B. tags¨¹ber. Dies kann man nur manuell (ja, am Ger_t und am Handy, aber so fortschrittlich ist das nun wirklich nicht) jeden Tag aufs neue einstellen. Wer generell aus gesundheitlichen Gr¨¹nden so ein Ger_t m_chte und somit nur eine einzige Luftfeuchtigkeit mit Zeitplan einstellen m_chte, wird mit dem Ger_t vielleicht gl¨¹cklicher. Auch die Funktion mit den _therischen _len ist f¨¹r mich irrelevant und kann ich daher nicht bewerten.
Dazu empfinde ich es bei einem eher hochpreisigen Ger_t als Selbstverst_ndlichkeit, dass es einigerma_en ""frustfrei verpackt"" ist. Es ist jedoch eher zweckm__ig verpackt, f¨¹r den Hersteller sicher. Ich pers_nlich finde ein solches Ger_t sollte auch einigerma_en gut aussehen und vielleicht bin ich da zu perfektionistisch, aber die Basis und der Tank wurden z.B. zum Versand mit so einem Draht-Plastik-Tape verbunden. Die Klebefl_che bekommt man weder mit etwas Desinfektion oder Gesichtswasser (die ¨¹blichen Hausmittel) weg. Mit Terpentin m_chte ich als Laie nicht an so d¨¹nne Plastikoberfl_chen ran. Ich freue mich schon darauf, wenn sich dort Staub und anderes klebriges Zeug sammelt..."
1912,Great humidifier,"Update: After 3 months of using it, the humidifier starts to leak water from below. I am quite disappointed.

I bought this humidifier on July 2021 for my cat who has very dry skin. I placed it next to her bed whose fur has since become super healthy. The unit is quite quiet, it requires to be refill with distilled water every other day. I have an iphone which might not be compatible with controlling the speed of misting. The only feature that is lacking is the blue night version that can ease my eyes in the dark."
1913,perfetto,"abbiamo acquistato questo prodotto per aumentare l'umidit¨¤ nella stanza durante il periodo estivo, con luso quotidiano del condizionatore. Ottimo sia per la sua funzionalit¨¤ e semplicit¨¤ di utilizzo, inoltre dice sia il grado di umidit¨¤ che si pu¨° in modalit¨¤ automatica far spegnere quando raggiunge il livello ottimale."
1914,Buen humidificador,"Lo compr¨¦ porque pod¨ªa usarlo con aceites es ¨¦nviales, la verdad es que huele delicioso el primer 1/4 del tanque. Despu¨¦s solo saca vapor y hay que poner mas aceite.
En realidad es un muy buen producto. Efectivamente cumple su funci¨®n y el poderlo controlar con Alexa o el celular es incre¨ªble."
1915,Muy agradable,"Silencioso, agradable y manejable."
1916,Nul .,Produit ¨¤ fuir ! Fuis au niveau de la base ! Je l¡¯ai renvoyer direct avec ¨¤ peine 24h d¡¯utilisation .

Proporciona um n¨ªvel de humidade ¨®ptimo para o quarto! Fica muito confort¨¢vel.
Conecta muito facilmente com o telem¨®vel."
1919,Que no hace ruido ninguno,"De momento va muy bien espero q no pase como con el otro q solo me ha durado 3 a_os cortos, que era de la misma marca."
1920,Justo lo que necesitaba.,"Muy completo y f¨¢cil de usar, (usando la app apropiada es mas completo que sin ella), estoy contento."
1921,Smart Living,"Super Luftbefeuchter, die Smartanbindung ist einfach genial!"
1922,"Gut, aber fiept"," Im Luftbefeuchten ist er gut. Das ist ja auch seine Hauptaufgabe. Er l_sst sich gut aus der Ferne bedienen und ist auch zuverl_ssig im autonomen Modus.

Leider ist er nicht wirklich ""leise"".
Er produziert neben einem gewissen Grundrauschen, T_ne in Frequenzen um die 10 kHz - also in etwa so wie das Fiepen von R_hrenfernsehern, nur leiser.
_ltere Menschen nehmen dieses Ger_usch zwar nicht wahr, aber Kinder und insbesondere Babys schon.
Ich pers_nlich finde das Ger_usch zum Schlafen zu unangenehm.

Der automatisch Midus hat meines Erachtens auch eine gro_e Schw_che. Man kann eine Ziel-Luftfeuchtigkeit einstellen und das Ger_t so einstellen, dass es bei 5% darunter bis auf 5% dar¨¹ber befeuchtet. So ist die Luftfeuchtigkeit irgendwo in einer Spanne von 10%, was bei Luftfeuchtigkeit schon ein ziemlicher Unterschied ist. Genauer l_sst es sich leider nicht festlegen.

Trotzdem bin ich mit dem Produkt relativ zufrieden."
1923,No lo recomiendo,Zumba.. hace un ruido q no me gusta y no da paz por todo lo demas es bueno
1924,Das Klima stimmt wieder,"Das Ger_t macht was es soll. Sehr leise, per WLAN steuerbar. L_nge Laufzeit mit einer F¨¹llung"
1925,Hat uns nicht ¨¹berzeugt,"Wir haben das Ger_t bestellt um die Luftfeuchtigkeit in unserem Schlafzimmer zu erh_hen.
Das Ger_t funktionierte einwandfrei, die Handhabung war leicht und vor allem die Steuerung ¨¹ber Wlan / die App war sehr praktisch. Auch die Ger_uschkulisse war in Ordnung. Man h_rt es schon, aber es ist nicht ¨¹berm__ig laut.
Leider waren wir von diesem Produkt dennoch nicht besonders ¨¹berzeugt. Er zeigte uns dauernd an, dass die Wunschluftfeuchtigkeit erreicht ist, obwohl sich subjektiv gesehen nichts ge_ndert hat. Daher haben wir das Ger_t nach einigen Tagen austesten schlie_lich zur¨¹ck geschickt.
Nun muss man dazu sagen dass wir in einem Altbau mit 3,50m hohen Decken und einem insgesamt sehr gro_en Schlafzimmer (ca.20 qm) wohnen. Vielleicht funktioniert es in kleineren R_umen besser.
Hinzu kommt, dass s_mtliche Spiegel im Schlafzimmer bereits nach den paar Tagen Gebrauch _blind¡° waren. Das mag aber auch an dem bei uns recht kalkhaltigen Wasser liegen."
1926,Excellent product,"Easy to use and excellent option to use Alexa to set times and also keeps to humidified option programmed giving off less noise than previous different product used before , kept looking at other makes but glad stuck with this choice  would recommend"
1927,Ok,Ok
1928,Nicht mein Ding,"Der Levoit Smart Luftbefeuchter lies sich gut in die App Vesinv und in der Alexa App intregieren. Ich habe diesen nach der Anleitung mit destillierten Wasser gef¨¹llt, aber dad Ger_t meinte, es w_re zu wenig Wasser drin. Habe diesen mehrmals resetet und auch angehoben, aber die Meldung kam immer. Mit der Zeit hat mich das Ding genervt und mich dazu entschlossen, es zur¨¹ck zu schicken. Daher f¨¹r mich nicht zu gebrauchen."
1929,Top!,H_lt was er verspricht. Auch f¨¹r gro_e R_ume super !
1930,Effective but not perfect,"An effective humidifier; when placed on ""high"" it kicks out an impressive plume of mist like a kettle on full boil, and as a result it has sufficient capacity to actually do the job properly, and quietly. The user interface is simple, as is the app, with straightforward and well-designed controls. Biggest issue: the built-in hydrometer is inaccurate. This may be the consequence of it being located in the humidifying unit, and it improves if you have good air circulation, or a fan blowing on it, but it consistently reads 10% higher than other, known-good sensors.  The ""Alexa"" integration is quite basic and a bit hit-and-miss; it consistently can turn the whole unit on and off, but other functions seem not to be recognised 100% (or at all). The only other (minor) niggle is the ""nightlight"" feels like an afterthought - it's in an odd location, and a bit of an odd colour as well. Would have been better with RGB or a proper warm white in the middle of the tank. In summary, an effective, quiet unit which has high capacity and can be turned on and off via mobile or Alexa."
1931,"big investment, a little dissapointed","if you live in an area where there is hard water, keep in mind this will be visible in the aerosols. This is something to keep in mind when you buy any kind of humidifier. Distilled water is an option if its not expensive in your area. Big tank, which is a plus side and is very easy to transport. The lamp isnt super bright, can barely see it. I like the app, it has minimal features but it is really handy to setup time frames when you want your humidifier to wor or when you wanna put if off from a distance. I dont know how accurate the humidity level sensor is as i dont have another device that does this, but the humidity display shows an increase in humidity right after i shower so it is somewhat accurate. The design is really chunky, so keep that in mind. Also only cold mist, but i dont think it makes a difference for your plants. This device didnt wow me, but it does the job and i dont have to refill my tank every day. All in all, 7/10"
1932,_ber Alexa bedienender!,"Da ich Multiple Sklerose habe, benutze ich Den _Nebelix¡° Haupts_chlich ¨¹ber Alexa. Das Ger_t ist vorbildlich!"
1933,Easy to fill but poor humidity control,"This humidifier has a large chamber to hold water and it is very easy to fill by lifting the lid.  However the control range is +/- 5% relative humidity so if you set at 60% it switches on at 55% and keeps going to 65% when it switches off again.  My older bottom filled machine has a much narrower activation range.  The controls are reliant on linking the humidifier to you phone.  I couldn't work out how the set the controls on the machine its self.
It is quiet while running."
1934,Humidificateu parfait,Je suis satisfait de cette appareil malgr¨¦ que les odeurs d'huile essentielle on les sent pas tr¨¨s bien c'est vrais que c'est un humidificateur mais pas un diffuseur d'huiles essentielles si non rien ¨¤ redire en mode automatique c'est le top l'appareil d¨¦tecte lui m¨ºme le taux d'humidit¨¦ sympa je le recommande pour un confort optimal pour notre sant¨¦
1935,F¨¹r Pflanzen ein Traum :),"Ich hatte zuvor den beliebten Vorg_nger, der zwei Verteilerd¨¹sen besitzt. Hier bei der WLAN Version gibt es nur eine Richtung aber daf¨¹r wird mit so viel Power der Nebel nach oben geschossen (bis zu 80 Cm) das es sich ¨¹berall verteilt. Dank Alexa oder der App sind nun feste Zeiten einprogrammierbar, somit wird der Raum vollautomaisch befeuchtet, so wie ich es immer wollte <3 Wasser h_lt bei mir f¨¹r 3 Wochen, wenn ich verteilt am Tag 40 Min laufen lasse."
1936,Too Ger_t,Ich bin absolut zufrieden mit dem Luftbefeuchter. Kinderleichte Einrichtung per App und h_lt die gew¨¹nschte Luftfeuchtigkeit zuverl_ssig. Klare Kaufempfehlung.

1939,Excelente producto,"Cumple todas las expectativas, en cuanto a los aceites depende mucho de la calidad de los mismo para que se logre tener el aroma, en cuanto a la integraci¨®n con alexa ha sido incre¨ªble"
1940,"Annoying noise, impossible to sleep","I used the device in my bedroom (way smaller than 44sq.m.) and measured the humidity level with a different device just 2 meters away from the humidifier. The device measurements were constantly at least 10% lower that the humidifier's own measurements.
But the most annoying thing is the noise: pretty loud buzzing sound. It's very annoying, I cannot sleep with this thing on, and it doesn't get any quieter in the sleep mode. The only difference in sleep mode is that the led lights turn themselves off.
This thing is going back."
1941,100% recommended,Very good quality humidifier! Super silent with great smartphone integration. I would buy again for sure!
1942,Test bestanden!,"Der Test hat gezeigt, dass ein Ultraschall Luftbefeuchter einen ganz feinen Wassernebel erzeugt. Aber wie gelingt das? Nun, ganz einfach: mit Schall. Um sich den Mechanismus zu verdeutlichen, der beim Ultraschall Luftbefeuchter wirkt, k_nnen Sie ein Glas Wasser auf einen Lautsprecher stellen. Stellen Sie nun die Lautst_rke ganz laut ein. Sie werden sehen, dass die Fl¨¹ssigkeit im Glas in Wallung ger_t. Nat¨¹rlich handelt es dabei nicht um Ultraschall. Deswegen f_llt der Effekt im Vergleich zum Ultraschall Luftbefeuchter sehr gering aus, das Prinzip ist aber das gleiche. In dem Wasserglas Experiment ist auch klar geworden, dass die Schwingung mit der Tonh_he zunimmt. Bei dem Ultraschall Luftbefeuchter aus dem Test wird ein sehr hochfrequenter Ton erzeugt, den Sie nicht h_hen k_nnen. Er ist so hoch, dass er das Wasser in sehr starke Schwingungen versetzt.

So stark, dass der feine Wassernebel entsteht, den die Experten im Test gesehen haben. Je h_her der Ton ist, desto feiner werden die Wasserperlen. Im Test hat sich gezeigt, dass die meisten Hersteller mit einer Frequenz von 1,8 Megaherz arbeiten. Das bedeutet, dass pro Sekunde 1,8 Millionen Schwingungen erzeugt werden. Das ist schon ziemlich viel. Im Vergleich finden sich aber auch Produkte, die mit zwei Megaherz arbeiten. Das l_sst den Neben im Ultraschall Luftbefeuchter noch feiner werden. Mehr ist ¨¹brigens technisch kaum m_glich.

Es ist problemlos m_glich, dem Wasser im Ultraschall Luftbefeuchter Duftstoffe zuzusetzen. Das hat dem Test zufolge keinerlei negative Auswirkungen. Das Wasser wird im Ultraschall Luftbefeuchter auch dann noch in einen feinen Nebel verwandelt. _brigens, je k_lter das Wasser ist, desto k¨¹hler wird auch der Nebel.
Im Test war zu beobachten, dass ein Ultraschall Luftbefeuchter unter Umst_nden sogar in der Lage ist, den Raum abzuk¨¹hlen. Im Vergleich sehen Sie deutlich: Je leistungsf_higer der Ultraschall Luftbefeuchter ist, desto st_rker f_llt der k¨¹hlende Effekt aus."

1947,Awesome humidifier,Wonderful humidifier. It looks exactly like the pictures and works as described. I was diagnosed with COVID and this helped with my breathing. There are timer settings and a way to schedule the machine to turn off and on with the settings at your convenience. It connects with wifi so you can control it away from home as well. I'm happy I invested into this smart machine as my first humidifier.

1949,Super,"Am besten ist bei diesem Luftbefeuchter, die App wo man das ganze ¨¹ber WLAN steuern kann. So kann ganz genau festgelegt werden wann das Ger_t ein oder ausschalten soll.
Kann es nur weiterempfehlen."
1950,Sehr effizienter und leiser Luftbefeuchter.,"Der Luftbefeuchter macht gut sein Job. Wir haben ihn im Schlafzimmer gestellt, die Luft wird auf der eingestellte Wert feucht gemacht. Man h_rt dabei ganz leichter Ger_usch, das man gar nicht wahrnimmt. Aus der D¨¹se kommt feiner Nebelstrahl ohne Geruch. Wird das Ger_t auf ""Auto"" gestellt, schaltet es sich aus, sobald die Luftfeuchtigkeit 40 Prozent erreicht. Bei den Stufen ""Low"", ""Med"" und ""High"" _ndert sich der Nebelstrahlh_he. Ich finde dieser Artikel sehr gut."
1951,3 Stockwerke auf 50%,"Moin zusammen,

ich muss f¨¹r das Ger_t eine Lanze brechen. Ich habe es das Wochenende ¨¹ber im Einsatz, da wir im Haus Eichenparkett und Bodenheizung haben. Dadurch ist die Luftfeuchtigkeit um die 40%.
Das Ger_t rennt seit Samstagmittag und wir haben sogar auf allen 3 Stockwerken ~50% (Wir haben es in den Flur ins 1 OG gestellt)

Bisher sind meine Erwartungen ¨¹bertroffen, schauen wir wie es weiter geht!
Gr¨¹_e"
1952,tolles Ger_t,"sehr leise und tut was es soll, die Steuerung ¨¹ber die App ist super und einfach...einen Punkt abzug gibt es daf¨¹r, dass man das Ger_t aller 10Tage zur¨¹cksetzten muss, sonst geht das automat. Ein-/Ausschalten ¨¹ber den Timer nicht mehr..."

1955,"Tolles Ger_t, sehr hochwertig und leiser Betrieb","Sehr hochwertig, sehr leise, einfache Inbetriebnahme und Bedienung, tolle App, gro_e F¨¹llmenge mit 6 Liter, hohe Befeuchtungsleistung. Ger_t sollte eher in der Raummitte aufgestellt werden um die Luftzirkulation zu erkennen."
1956,white dust,"works well, is quiet, does humidify my ~45 sqm apartment. Although you cannot use tap water or brita filtered water if you have hard tap water. visible layer of white dust all over room within 3 days of use. Room is filled with white fog. So you have to use distilled, purified or demineralized water if you want to have clean air in your home, which will be expensive in a long run. I'd suggest other humidifiers if you do not want to deal with that, although other options which do not create white dust (with tap water) are considerably louder and usually cost more straight up.

Where I live i can buy a 5l jug of distilled water for 2 euros. The humidifier seems to take about 10 litres per day on high, so thatll be about 120 euros per month - not worth."
1957,Very poor smart features,"I bought this humidifier as I thought that the smart features will help me maintain a more accurate humidity. Firstly, out of the box, the auto-mode, which has a 10% range (5% +/ target will stop or start the device) is much too wide.
Alexa can only accept commands. There is no event support for humidity levels in routines. Then i turned to IFTT and discovered that this humidifier does not support IFTTT either.  The IOT implementation is through the VeSync service which is completely locked down. So all in all an expensive device with very little functionality."
1958,L'humidificateur fuit au niveau de sa base ...,L'humidificateur fuit au niveau de sa base ...
1959,Unsuitable for aromatherapy,"Do not buy if intended use is 'aromatherapy.'
Barely any scent is notable.
The owners manual actually states it's not intended for this purpose, leading me to think this is an inaccurate product description. No partial refund will be offered, leaving the headache of returning."
1960,Humidifier sensor could be of a higher quality.,Humidifier sensor is not accurate but paying attention to location will mitigate this situation. I raised from the floor and away from the wall.Everything well now.Humidity readings from device are within2-5% with my other hygrometers.

Der Aufbau, die Installation der App (iOS) sowie die Anbindung an _Alexa¡° ist gut beschrieben und ging kinderleicht. Nach gef¨¹hlten 10min ist das Ger_t ( ich nenne in Nebelix) startklar und verrichtet fl¨¹sterleise seinen Dienst. Am Ger_t sowie auch ¨¹ber Alexa oder der App ist die Gew¨¹nschte Luftfeuchtigkeit sowie An/ Aus steuerbar ( Die Programmierung eines Zeitplanes ist ¨¹ber die App m_glich) Die Beleuchtung ist f¨¹r mich ein Gimmick, ob man das kleine L_mpchen wirklich braucht, ist nat¨¹rlich Geschmacksache.
